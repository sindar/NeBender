- - Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
  - $500, you say?
# Bender: [to judge] Ma'am, I have a late entry: My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
# [Zoidberg stands on all-fours and wears a blue cape and a nappy. Bender whips him and he woops. He whips him again and Zoidberg woops and waves his claws in the air.]
# [Time Lapse. The crowd cheers for Zoidberg and Bender. Zoidberg scurries through a tunnel with Bender whipping him as he goes.]
# Bender: Faster! Faster.
# [Zoidberg woops. He comes out of the tunnel, jumps on to a balance beam and somersaults across it. Bender hits him again.]
# Zoidberg: Ow!
# Bender: Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
# [Time Lapse. Zoidberg stands on a table and a judge inspects him. He looks in his mouth and then tickles his arm. Zoidberg laughs.]
# Bender: Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
# [Time Lapse. Zoidberg dances for the judges in the talent competition and Bender watches from ringside.]
# Bender: I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
- - Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier.
  - Second place? That's a fancy word for losing. You didn't stick your landing!
- - Forgive me, my friend.
  - Never!
# Leela: Why is that good news?
# Farnsworth: They paid in advance.
# [Comical twang. Bender bangs his chest.]
# Bender: Excuse me.
# Hermes: This is mighty strange. [He presses a remote control, the lights dim and a holographic display comes up on the table showing a series of planets.] First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12.
# Fry: Leela back yet?
# Bender: Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
- - You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
  - Sure ... right. Robot! Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
- - Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
  - Am I a robot?
- - Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
  - Fry! My skin!
- - Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
  - Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!
# Fry: Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents. [He takes a head in a jar out of the box.] This was our first president, George Washington. [The staff stare blankly. Amy twitches and Farnsworth scratches his head.] Let's review. Who was our first president?
# Amy: Um.
# Bender: A pickle jar?
# Washington: Thomas Jefferson?
- - Let's review. Who was our first president?
  - A pickle jar?
