conversations:
# [Scene: Outside The Wongs' House. Lots of people have gathered at the ranch for country music and barbecued buggalo on Mars Day. The DJ scratches some country music.]
# Bender: Yeah, yeah, get on down! [He scratches again.] Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
# [Scene: Mars Surface. Kif, Leela and Fry ride ahead while Bender sits on a wagon playing a banjo and singing a Bonanza-like tune.]
# Bender: [singing] : We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,
# Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,
# He'd better bite my ass!
# [Scene: Olympus Mons. The party have set up camp for the night. Bender tells a ghost story around the campfire.]
# Bender: And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
# Fry: Pft, that's not scary!
# Bender: It is if you're a laser printer.
- - Pft, that's not scary!
  - It is if you're a laser printer.
# Leela: Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
# Fry: With pleasure. [spookily] Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
# Bender: [speaking fast] Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! [normal] Sorry, go on.
- - Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
  - Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! Sorry, go on.
# Amy: Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
# Leela: Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
# Amy: Well, actually--
# Bender: Too late! This is more fun!
- - Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
  - Too late! This is more fun!
# Leela: [shouting] Sandstorm! [The tornado picks up the buggalo and them. They tumble around inside the tornado and then fall to the ground.] We're in the eye of the storm!
# Fry: Where?
# Bender: What's that?
# [The Martians fly away.]
# Kif: Amy! Nooo!
# [He cries.]
# Bender: Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
- - Amy! Nooo!
  - Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
- - This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--
  - Damn you, old man!
- - You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
  - Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
# [Kif takes a puff and everyone cheers.]
# Fry: Yeah!
# Zapp: Yes, sir!
# Bender: Way to suck it!
# Leela: It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
# Singing Wind: Really?
# [The diamond stops and Kif sighs. Bender takes a look at the diamond through an eye glass and stutters.]
# Bender: Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
- - Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
  - So we can have the diamond?
