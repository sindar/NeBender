conversations:
# [Scene: Ships Cockpit. Fry and Leela sit at their stations. Bender stands at the back of the room by a port that looks like the HAL 9000 ports from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The ship speaks with a male voice.]
# Bender: You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship.
- - Whoa, whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
  - Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
- - Oh, it's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
  - Why not, indeed?
- - Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
  - Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
# [He walks out. The door closes on him and cuts his head off. It lands on the floor and rolls a little.]
# Ship: [sarcastic] Oops! Sorry!
# [He laughs.]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff sit around the table. Bender screws his head back on.]
# Bender: Ah, that Ship is so white bread!
# Farnsworth: You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?
# Leela: Yeah, sure.
# Bender: [unenthusiastic] Oh, sure.
- - You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?
  - Oh, sure.
# [The crew look around the cockpit. Leela points to a glass case with a green cloud in it.]
# Leela: Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor.
# Fry: And you got a cage for the lion!
# [The cage is in the ceiling. The lion growls and reaches through the bars, taking a swipe at Fry. Bender turns the radio on and Spin Doctors' Two Princes plays.]
# Bender: Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!
# Farnsworth: Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
# Ship: Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
# Bender: Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
- - Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed. Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
  - Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
# [He rolls his sleeves up.]
# Farnsworth: It even comes with an adjustable voice.
# [He turn a knob on the radio.]
# Ship: [male voice] We each get one of the four buttons. [female voice] Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
# [She giggles.]
# Bender: What? Did you just say--
- - Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
  - What? Did you just say--
- - If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy. Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!
  - Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?
# [Cut to: Ships Engine Room. Bender tickles an access panel.]
# Bender: Coochie, coochie!
- - Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
  - You know you love it, sugar-engine!
- - Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--
  - Buddy, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty. #buddy = Fry
- - Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
  - That's what makes it so nasty!
# [Montage: Bender sings Daisy Bell while dating the ship. First he sits on one of the tail fins with a picnic set up. The sheet blows in the breeze of space.]
# Bender: [singing] : Daisy, Daisy,
# Give me your answer do,
# [He pours beer into one of the fuel hatches. Later, in the Planet Express hangar, Bender catches Fry mopping Ship and hits him.]
# Bender: I'm half crazy,
# All for the love of you,
# It won't be a stylish marriage,
# [Hermes checks an equipment locker in the ship and a sleeping Bender tumbles out.]
# Bender: I can't afford a carriage,
# [In the hangar, Bender and Fry hide and watch Amy, in her underwear, wash the ship.]
# Bender: But you'll look sweet,
# Upon the seat,
# Of a bicycle built for two.
# [Scene: Outside Planet Express. Bender and Ship dance on the roof under the moonlight.]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Leela reads a newspaper while Fry is still searching for the perfect candy heart.]
# Bender: Well, I'm sick of her.
- - The ship? But you just started dating.
  - With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
- - Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
  - In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
# [Leela grunts.]
# Leela: Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
# [Bender laughs.]
# Bender: Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
- - Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
  - Hahahahaha. Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
- - What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?
  - Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!
- - Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?
  - Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
- - Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
  - Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
- - Bender! Are you looking at other women?
  - No, baby, never!
- - Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!
  - OK, I like a challenge. No ... no. Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants.
- - Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
  - Phew!
# [She blasts off. Bender's chest cabinet opens revealing Lucy Liu's head in a jar.]
# Liu: Who are you talking to?
# Bender: No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
- - Who are you talking to?
  - No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
# Leela: Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
# Bender: Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends.
# Ship: [screaming] Nooo!
# [She jerks to a stop.]
# Bender: So we're cool?
# [Cut to: Fry's and Bender's Quarters. They both lie in their hammocks.]
# Bender: [singing] Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!
- - You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!
  - Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
- - In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity.
  - Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
- - Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
# Fry: Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
- - Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
  - Float for your lives!
- - Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain.
  - It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
# [Beat.]
# Leela: I'm willing to take that risk.
# [Scene: Ships Cockpit. The ship gets closer to the quasar. Bender floats in. There are candy hearts everywhere.]
# Bender: Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.
# [Ship gasps.]
# Ship: You really mean it?
# Bender: Uh... [He looks at his hand. "Yes" is written on it.] Yes!
# [He pulls out a wire from inside the control panel and connects himself via a modem.]
# [Scene: Ship's Mind. Bender's head appears on a motherboard. Ship glows and has eyes and a mouth]
# Bender: Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
- - Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!
  - I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
- - We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!
  - Nooo!
# [Scene: Ships Cockpit. Bender has separated from the ship. He wakes up. Enter Fry and Leela.]
# Fry: Bender! Are you OK?
# Bender: Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
- - Bender! Are you OK?
  - Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
- - Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
  - Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. A cuddly baby tapir! And that's why I love him!
