# Florp: Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!

  - Alright, Zoidberg!
# Zoidberg: Earth: What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you. [There is silence.] Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. [shouting] On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet--
# [A tomato hits him in the face and he eats it. At their table, Bender stresses back a spoon back.]
# Bender: Reload.
# Tour Guide: Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour! [She laughs to herself.] I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios. [The building looks just like the logo for 20th Century Fox, updated slightly.] Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes.

  - Neat!
# Tour Guide: Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead. [Gibson's head in a jar peeps through the door of his tiny house.] And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?
- - And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?
  - Oh! I am! Me! Bender is!
- - Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
  - Yes, I will.
- - Are you my new hot water heater?
  - No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
# Calculon: Absolutely not.
# Bender: Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?
- - Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested. ave you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender!
  - Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
- - Nice work, Boiler.
  - Thanks. And call me Bender.
# Bender: What's with Monstro?
# Fry: He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
- - I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
  - Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.
- - Since when have you been in the biz?
  - Long enough, little man. Long enough.
# Bender: Calculon, as your hot water heater ... [Calculon uses Bender as a hot water caddy and pours water into a mug with a tea bag in it.] ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.
# Calculon: Of course. Tell me about the project.
# Zoidberg: It's a movie.
# Calculon: Interesting. Tell me more.
# Bender: Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.
# Calculon: And?
# Bender: And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
- - Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
  - I can guarantee anything you want.
# Calculon: Then I'll do it!
# Zoidberg: Hooray!
# [Bender opens his chest cabinet.]
- - Then I'll do it!
  - Here's your chequebook.
- - Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't - A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being President of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is Vice President.
  - That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
- - Bender, you said "wink, wink" out loud.
  - No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.
- - Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
  - Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
# [The film ends with Bender credited as executive producer.]
# Bender: [cheering] Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
- - Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
  - Now you know why I use the qualifier, "practically".
- - He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?
  - Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
- - OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination.
  - Wink.
# Calculon: 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
# Zoidberg: But you won this Golden Globe!
# Calculon: Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! [He throws it towards Bender. He dodges it and it hits an All My Circuits: The Movie poster.] I told you I want an Oscar.
- - I told you I want an Oscar.
  - Then maybe you should act better.
# Zoidberg: This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
# Zoid: No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision.
# Bender: Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
- - I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision.
  - Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
# [The gorilla walks up the carpet. Around the back, Bender, wearing a chef's hat, pushes a trolley towards a door. A doorman stops him.]
# Bender: Catering.
- - What category are they on?
  - They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
# Bender: And now to present the award for Best Actor ... [Zoidberg walks onto the stage.] ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ... [The audience murmur.] ... Dr. Zoidberg.
# Zoid: Thank you, nephew. [He kisses him.] Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us.
# [Calculon and Boxy walk in.]
# Calculon: Harold Zoid!
# Bender: Hit the deck!
- - Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own.
  - Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
# Zoidberg: Earthquake!
# Bender: Hit the deck!
