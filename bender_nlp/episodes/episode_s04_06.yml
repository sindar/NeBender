# Farnsworth: Oh, my.
# Bender: Here we go, y'all!
# Zoidberg: Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg. [he babbles rhymthically]
# Bender: This is a story about all my friends!
# Cubert: This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
# Dwight: Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot.
# Cubert: Well, mine's louder!
# Bender: Cram a ham in it, you twerps! [He throws his beer bottle at them, it misses and hits Fry, who squeals.] Sorry!
# Bender: [shouting; from lounge] Something's happening on television.
# [He stops talking and starts to fizzle. His pupils go crazy and he starts groaning. Monique and Calculon glance at each other in confusion.]
# Bender: Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
# [Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim sit around the table, bored. Enter Bender with the TV.]
# Bender: [gasping] Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
# Linda: [on TV] Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him.
- - Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him.
  - An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
# Tinny Tim: What's that, sir?
# Bender: That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
- - What's that, sir?
  - That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
- - Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south and join the robo-bandidos at Veracruz.
  - Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
- - At Veracruz. So, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho
  - Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
# [Cut to: Outside All My Circuits Casting Office. Bender is right outside the door.]
# Bender: [shouting] Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
- - Have you ever been on TV before?
  - Once, when I took those hostages.
- - I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
  - Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!
- - However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!
  - Father-o!
- - Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ... whose name I never learned.
  - Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
- - Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities.
  - So now my character has a British accent?
- - No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move. And ... action!
  - Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
- - Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma.
  - Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
- - Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--
  - Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me "Bender"! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. C'mon, baby! Come on!
- - I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
  - Bite my shiny metal ass! Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
# [Scene: All My Circuits Editing Room. Calculon and the director watch Bender's antics.]
# Bender: [on TV] Bite my shiny metal ass! [He starts dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
# Bender: Now that's hospital dancing. [He nudges Calculon.] Pretty good, eh, Calcky?
- - We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?
  - Yes, I can.
# Hermes: Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
# [Time Lapse. Farnsworth and Hermes are gone, replaced by Fry, Leela, Zoidberg and Bender on the couch. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim sit on the floor all watching TV.]
# Bender: OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part.
# [On the TV Calculon and Monique enter a cabin covered in snow.]
# Monique: [on TV] Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender.
# [She gasps. Bender is guzzling down a keg of beer on the other side of the room. He cheers and lights his finger like a lighter.]
# Bender: [on TV] Try this, kids at home!
- - Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
  - That's crazy!
# Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
# Zoidberg: That was uncanny.
# Hermes: Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
# Farnsworth: And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
# Hermes: No, sir! Not us FARTers.
# Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
- - Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.

# [Bumper: The Futurama logo appears.]
# Bender: [voice-over] You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
# [Bender's loot safe opens and Bender steps out of it and yawns and stretches.]
# Bender: What? What's going on?
# Farnsworth: I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
# Hermes: And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk.
# Bender: Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole! [He takes Playbot from Tinny Tim.] That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
- - I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes. And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk.

# [Scene: Outside Planet Express. At the back of the building hundreds of angry dads are crowded around to hear Bender make a speech. The back of the hangar has been opened so the ship is right behind him. Bender stands at a lectern with Farnsworth and Hermes beside him.]
# Bender: Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? [The dads cheer.] Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
# FART Mob: [chanting] Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
# [The stop marching when they reach a security barrier. Bender takes care of it.]
# Bender: This mob's with me.
- - Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
  - This mob's with me.
- - Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob.
  - Yeah!
# Hermes: You'd better believe it!
# Calculon: Great Shatner's ghost!
# Bender: We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
# Farnsworth: Booya!
- - I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no.
  - Then I quit.
# Network President: Then you don't quit. [His CD-ROM drive opens and one of the Execubots puts a gun in it and connects it to him.] I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty.
# Farnsworth: There'll be no further nasty. [He takes a laser out of his lab coat.] We still have the option of resorting to violence.
# Hermes: What makes you think that'll work?
# Farnsworth: I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
# [Bender dances around smoking a cigar.]
# Bender: Ooh, yeah! C'mon--
# [He panics as Farnsworth points his laser at him.]
# Farnsworth: Quit the show!
# Network President: Do the scene.
# [Bender puts his hands up.]
# Farnsworth: I'm a cold-blooded punk!
# Network President: I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
# Bender: Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
# [The Execubot turns around with the president in his hands.]
# Network President: Really?
# Farnsworth: Wha?
# [Bender yoinks the guns from their hands.]
# Bender: Aha!
# [Farnsworth gasps.]
# Farnsworth: I was using that!
# Bender: Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
# Director: You're angry.
# Bender: Perfect. [He turns to the camera.] Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do. [He blows some cigar smoke.] How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is "yes". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! [He accidentally fires Farnsworth's laser and a laser bolt flies over Farnsworth's head, narrowly missing him. Bender clears his throat.] Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you! [He points his firearms at the FART mob and they gasp and duck.] And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
- - We're just so busy.
  - Well make time.
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge.]
# Bender: [on TV] : Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
- - Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.
  - Damn right!
# [They all turn back to the screen and watch Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.]
