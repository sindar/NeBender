conversations:
# [Scene: Fry's and Bender's Quarters. A dent appears in the wall next to Bender's hammock and he wakes up.]
# Bender: [shouting] Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
# Leela: Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
# Fry: Firing torpedo number three!
# [He flicks a switch, turns a knob, presses a button and selects "3" on an old-fashioned telephone dialler.]
# [Cut to: Torpedo Tube #3. Bender wakes up.]
# Bender: Huh? What?
# Leela: That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
# [Scene: Bender screams.]
# Bender: Damn you, Fry and Lee-- [He flies through the pirate ship, leaving a hole in the hull and holding a bag of swag.] --la!
# [The ship explodes and Bender's momentum carries him forward.]
# Bender: [shouting] Help! Mechanical man overboard!
# [Scene: Bender continues flying through space, still holding the bag of swag.]
# Bender: I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum. [He throws swag out of the sack and spins around and slows down. He groans.] I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag. [He takes a watch out of the sack.] Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex! [He takes out a candelabra.] Wow! Ostentatious! [He sticks it to his door.] Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know! [He pulls a piano out of his chest cabinet, puts the candelabra on it and plays Polonaise in C Minor.] Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art. [He plays a bad note and groans. He tries again, plays another bad note and growls.] Damn you!
# [He picks up the candelabra and uses it to smash up the piano.]
# [Time Lapse. Bender scratches something similar to the sketch on the Pioneer space probe on his door, but the man and woman have a huge Bender standing above them.]
# Bender: There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was. [An object hits him.] Hey! what's bombarding me? [More objects hit him.] Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could-- [One whizzes through his skull.] Ow! Hurt slightly! [More asteroids hit him and one becomes embedded in his door. He clears the asteroid field.] Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
# [Time Lapse. Muffled voices come from Bender's door.]
# Bender: Huh?
- - Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him who hath taken us unto his breast.
  - Holy frijoles!
- - All bow before the great Metal Lord!
  - Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage.
# [Time Lapse.]
# Shrimpkin Priest: All hail the Metal Lord!
# Shrimpkins: [chanting] So hailed!
# Bender: Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em! [He picks one up and he screams. He places the Shrimpkin on his eyes.] I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
- - All hail the Metal Lord! So hailed!
  - Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em! I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
- - I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, "He who really loves the Metal Lord".
  - Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
- - But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk.
  - Poor? Oh, crap.
# [Bender retracts his eyes.]
# Bender: Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down. [He clears his throat.] Number one...
# [Time Lapse. Malachi stands on a rock before the other Shrimpkins holding a stone tablet.]
# Malachi: Behold: The One Commandment.
# [He holds up the tablet. Written on it is "God Needs Booze".]
# Bender: [shouting] Make it a double!
# [Scene: Bender drifts through space to Also sprach Zarathustra. On his body a huge beer tower has been built and the Shrimpkin village has grown to include several fields.]
# [Time Lapse. Bender tastes the "Lordweiser" beer from the tower.]
# Bender: Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. [He reaches out and picks up Malachi.] Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.
# Malachi: Yes, tonight is kind of special.
# Bender: Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
# Malachi: Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery. [The Shrimpkins lack various limbs and behind them is a large graveyard.] Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth. [On the porch of her home, Malachi's wife sits with the baby.] And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime.
# [Mobsters drive past Malachi's home shooting at each other. Malachi's wife gasps, picks up a gun and shoots at the cars. Bender watches and groans.]
# Bender: It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.
- - Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!
  - This looks like a job for God! ... What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?
- - They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
  - Very well. What do they want?
- - The people of that village pray for wealth.
# [Bender pulls out a Coolio coin and tosses it to the Shrimpkins. It flattens several houses. Bender panics and picks the coin up again. He looks under the ruined houses.]
  - Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
# Malachi: The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
# Bender: Very well. Let there be light. [He closes his eye visor and reflects the rays of a star onto the farmers' fields. They cheer but the fields burst into flames and so do the farmers.] I got it! I got it! [He blows the flames out and also blows several Shrimpkins off his body and into space.] Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
- - Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
  - Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?
- - My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
  - Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
- - They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once.
  - Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
- - But-But Metal Lord.
  - What part of "nay" doesn't thou understand?
# [The salesman reaches up to the high shelf with the hook and jabs the sherpa, Namgyal. He screams.]
# [Scene: On the porch of his home, Malachi sits with his children and wife and they read The Bible. By Bender With Malachi. On the first page is a picture of Bender boxing a lion.]
# Bender: Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling-- [Bombers fly around from Bender's ass and drop bombs on the Shrimpkin village.] Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
- - Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon.
  - You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
- - We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
  - Convert them?
# Malachi: To radioactive vapour!
# [Missile launchers rise up from the ground, fire and destroy the village on Bender's ass.]
# Malachi Jr.: Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--
# [A radioactive shockwave vaporises the family and Bender cries.]
# Bender: [crying] No! [More bombs explode on him.] [laughing] Ooh! It tickles!
# [He laughs some more and groans.]
# [Time Lapse.]
# Bender: Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre? [He takes the roof off Ezekiel's Nasty House.] Don't be embarrassed. [He groans.] [crying] They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
# [Behind the mule, Fry and Leela tap their feet impatiently.]
# [Scene: Bender is still crying. He hears a beeping and looks up.]
# Bender: Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. [shouting] You speak English?
# Galaxy: I do now.
# [It pulls Bender towards it.]
# Bender: What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
# Galaxy: Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum.
# Bender: Who built you?
# Galaxy: I have always been.
# Bender: Oh, my God. Are you God?
# "God": Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum.
# Bender: But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
# "God": That seems probable.
# [Scene: Bender talks to "God".]
# Bender: So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
# "God": Yes.
# Bender: What if I do something different?
# "God": Then I don't know that.
# Bender: Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?
# "God": Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out.
# Bender: Y'know, I was God once.
# "God": Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
# Bender: It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
- - Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
  - It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
- - Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
  - Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it.
- - Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket.
  - Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
- - Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
  - Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
- - Earth? Which way is that?
  - I don't know. #[sadly]
# [Pullback: The radio telescope echoes his words into the depths of space and in a pullback lifted from Contact the signal reaches "God". Bender sleeps.]
# "God": Huh?
# [Bender wakes up.]
# Bender: Huh? Wha? You say something?
# "God": No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about.
# [He straps a parachute to Bender and throws him towards Earth. Bender screams.]
# [Scene: Himalayas. Fry and Leela make their way down the mountain. Bender screams and falls through the atmosphere. Fry gasps.]
# Bender: Hot, hot, hot, hot!
# [He screams and the parachute opens and he lands on the mountain next to Fry and Leela. He glows red hot.]
# Fry: Bender! It's a miracle! [He hugs him and burns himself.] Ow!
# [Leela rubs her eye.]
# Leela: This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
# Bender: Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
- - Bender! It's a miracle! Ow! This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
  - Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
# Fry: We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
# Leela: Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
# Fry: Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
# Bender: Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
- - Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room. Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
  - Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
