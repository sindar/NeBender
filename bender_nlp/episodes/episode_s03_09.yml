  - Set a course for adventure!
# Fry: Ew!
# Bender: What a dump!
# Fry: Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
# Bender: And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
# Fry: I don't see you anywhere.
# Leela: That's me over in Cootietown.
# [She points at herself, standing apart from the group. Bender points at someone in the back row.]
# Bender: Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
# Vogel: Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex.
# Fry: [thoughtful] Really?
# Vogel: Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
- - Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex. Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
  - $100 a week?
# Bender: Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
- - Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
  - No. It's called "parenting". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.
# Bender: Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
# Kids: [chanting] Hello, jerkbags!
- - Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
  - Kids have names?
- - My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--
  - And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
- - Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
  - What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food! Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
- - Can we have Bender burgers again?
  - No. The cat shelter's on to me!
# Bender: OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?
# Albert: Yeah.
# Bender: Then knock yourself out. [The kids scream and run off, eating things and spinning around on bar stools.] Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here
- - Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
  - Here.
- - These kids yours?
  - Yeah.
- - Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
  - That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.
- - Daddy Bender?
  - Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
- - I love you, Daddy Bender!
  - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
# Fembot: I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
# [She leaves.]
# Bender: You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it! [The kids cheer.] [grumbling] Oh, come on!
# Hermes: Daylight come!
# [Bender runs through the restaurant carrying a high chair.]
# Bender: Coming through, watch your heads
# Zoidberg: Help! I'm under attack!
# [He sprays the others with ink. Bender sits with the kids at another table.]
# Bender: Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
# Elzar: Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
# [Sam comes out of Bender's chest door.]
# Sam: Me!
# Bender: Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
# [The boy turns to Elzar.]
# Sam: 'Bout time!
# Bender: That's my boy!
# Elzar: And here's your check. Bam!
# [Bender looks at it and gasps. Albert taps his arm.]
# Albert: I gotta go poopy!
# Bender: Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
- - And here's your check. Bam! I gotta go poopy!
  - Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
- - Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.
  - Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
# Sally: Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
# Kids: [chanting] Story! Story! Story!
# Bender: Alright, fine, gather round.
- - Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
  - Alright, fine, gather round.
- - We wanna hear this one again!
  - Bender's Arrest Record by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.
# Albert: Yeah, show us the picture! [Bender shows them a picture of him with a stolen watch on his arm. The kids laugh.] There he is!
# Bender: OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed. [The kids groan.] The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
# Bender: Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! [He and Fry sit down at a cable spool that has been turned over to make a table. Bender looks over his accounts and mutters.] Oh! I need a calculator.
- - You are a calculator.
  - I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper-- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!
# - - There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
#   - I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
- - Daddy, how do I flush you?
  - Just go to bed! # [shouting]
# Bender: Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check. [He picks up Albert.] Oh, aren't you a cutie? [He puts him down and picks up the phone.] About 35lbs. [Fry taps his shoulder.] What?
- - Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
  - Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?
- - Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
  - Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
# [Bender pushes Nina forward.]
# Bender: Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
# Leela: Uh, um.
# Adlai: Hmm.
# Bender: If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. [He picks up Sally, who is wearing a sash with "As Is" written on her.] Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called "love".
# Sally: One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
# Leela: Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
# Bender: OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.
- - But it's 10 in the morning!
  - I said hit the hay!
# [The kids run.]
# [Cut to: Fry's and Bender's Spare Room. The kids get into bed and Bender flicks the light off.]
# Leela: Oh, they're all so adorable.
# Bender: Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
- - Oh, they're all so adorable.
  - Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
- - You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
  - If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!
# [She shows him a crude picture of him and the kids.]
# Sally: So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
# [Bender takes the picture.]
# Bender: Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! [He screws it up and throws it in his chest cabinet. The kids sigh and walk away.]
# [Bender checks they're gone and takes the screwed up paper out of his cabinet and sticks it to the inside of his door. He sighs.]
# [kids cheer after seeing his actions, run back and jump on him with hugs.] Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! [shouting] I hate you! I hate you all!
- - So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
  - Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! ... Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! I hate you! I hate you all!
