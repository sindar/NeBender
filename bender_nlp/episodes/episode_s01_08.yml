- - It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
  - Sounds boring.
# Bender: I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Part√© and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
# Waiter: Exquisite choices, sir.
# Bender: And mix them all together in a big jug.
- - Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
  - Yep!
- - What is it? Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
  - Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
- - Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory. My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
  - Well, let's get looting!
- - We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
  - Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
- - Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.
  - Oh, crap!

- - Eat my shorts!
  - OK Mmm! Shorts!
- - Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here. Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes. 5 minutes. "6h" minutes?
  - There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
- - We're gonna die! Right?
  - Right!
# Bender: It's gonna blow!
- - Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
  - OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
