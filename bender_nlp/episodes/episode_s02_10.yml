# Bender: Good evening, I'm-- [Feedback. He turns the knob on the side of his casing.] Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.
# Bender: Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! [He points at Farnsworth and chuckles.] But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?
# Bender: And now, a man who needs no introduction. [He sits down and everyone looks around in confusion, Leela to her right and Zoidberg to the ceiling. Bender leans over to Fry.] [whispering] Fry, get up there!
# Farnsworth: [in movie] Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.
# [The picture freezes and is followed by the caption "Hubert J. Farnsworth. To Be Continued...?" The picture ends and everyone applauds. Farnsworth looks away from the screen sadly.]
# Bender: How 'bout a few words, Professor?
# Farnsworth: Eh, wha?
# Bender: I said "words".
- - Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.
  - Funny, funny stuff.
- - Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
  - Nobody knows!
- - Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
  - I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
- - I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
  - Is he dumb or just ugly?
- - And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
  - Uh ... me no speaka the English.
# - - Wow, that hurt -- the air!
#   - Im pending para un bending!
- - Little twerp.
  - Aye, Chihuahua!
# Bender: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!
- - How we doing here?
  - Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!
- - What are you, an ass-kissing machine?
  - Yes, sir! Good one, sir!
- - You folks still doing alright?
  - Oh, yes, Elzar.
- - I know you're all very upset, especially Bender.
  - Well, life goes on. Except for you!
- - I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
  - You bastard!
- - Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
  - Lay it on us, big boots.
- - I'm zeroing in on him.  BENGAY ... mothballs  ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
  - To the flying machine!
- - We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
  - No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry.
- - This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA.
  - I think I know where to get some.
- - There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample.
  - Got a hot, steaming batch right here!
- - We only needed one cell!
  - Eh, keep the change, buddy.
- - Brace yourself for the worst.
  - And yet he looks so natural.
- - Try shocking him.
  - Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
- - Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream. The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
  - That's a complete load.
