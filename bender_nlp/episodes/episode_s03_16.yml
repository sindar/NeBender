# Blek: It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free. [He sees Fry, Bender and Leela through the window.] Ooh! Customers! [Enter the trio.] Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you.
# [Bender sits down and the Cygnoid bends his legs up.]
# Bender: Ooh! That's a-comfy!
- - Ooh! Customers! Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you.
  - Ooh! That's a-comfy!
# [Leela gasps.]
# Leela: [shouting] Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
# [Another Cygnoid steps up.]
# Bender: No batter! No batter! [Leela pitches and knocks the second Cygnoid over.] No batter anymore.
# Leela: [shouting] I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
# Cygnoid #2: Yeah, me too now.
# [A third Cygnoid goes to bat.]
# Bender: Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter! [The ball hits the Cygnoid.] Duck!
# [A crowd of people gather around and start watching the game. Another Cygnoid goes to bat.]
# Cygnoid #3: Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?
# [Leela beans him.]
# Bender: Apparently not.
# [Leela walks away and bumps into Abner Doubledeal.]
# Doubledeal: Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
# Leela: Am I under arrest?
# Bender: Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
- - Go, Leela!
  - Come on, girl!
# [Leela beans Bjornson, knocking him over. The crowd gasps.]
# Bender: Bullseye!
- - Bender, how did you get in here?
  - As your agent, I have access to you at all times.
- - Since when are you my agent?
  - Quiet, call coming in. ... Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
- - Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?
  - One hundred dollars.
# [Scene: Mets Locker Room. Leela dresses. Enter Bender.]
# Bender: You're the best, babe! [His phone rings.] Hang on. Call comin' in. [He picks up.] What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
- - So what did you get me?
  - A thousand and one pesos!
# Girl: Well, uh ... to eBay?
# Leela: That's a popular name today. Little "e" big "B"?
# [The girl nods and smiles. Leela signs the magazine and the girl takes it and leaves. Another girl hands Leela a magazine. Bender chuckles and presses some buttons on a calculator.]
# Bender: Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!
# [She leaves. Leela's lip wobbles and a tear trickles down her face. Bender turns to the crowd.]
# Bender: Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!
# Amy: Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform.
# Leela: [crying] That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
# Bender: You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
- - That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
  - You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
- - Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers.
  - When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
- - Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high.
  - It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
# [Leela shakes his hand.]
# Fry: Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
# Aaron Sr.: No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!
# Bender: Neat!
- - No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!
  - Neat!
- - OK, let's see what you can do.
  - One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
# Leela: OK. Eye off the ball.
# [She throws the ball without looking at it, Aaron swings, misses and Fry catches the ball.]
# Bender: Strike!
- - OK. Eye off the ball.
  - Strike!
# Farnsworth: [shouting] Go, Leela!
# Amy: [shouting] Come on, Leela!
# Bender: [shouting] Put it right down the pike!

  - Put it right down the pike!
