- - I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!
  - Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Buddy, could you go make some popcorn? #buddy = Fry
# [Cut to: Ships Cockpit.]
# Leela: [shouting] Fry, get up here! It's starting!
# Farnsworth: Focus!
# [Leela twiddles his glasses and he smiles, satisfied.]
# [Scene: The star explodes and a wave of red light moves out from it. It hits the ship.]
# [Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Red light engulfs the cockpit and the crew gasp. The red light reaches the consoles.]
# Bender: Oh, boy!
- - Not if I can help it! Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts.
  - Ah, those things cost more lives than they save.
- - Bender, are you OK?
  - I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
- - Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
  - Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
- - Have you seen today's news?
  - High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
- - No, over here! Flying saucer captured!
  - That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
# [The sergeant walks away and Enos walks towards the kitchen. A Jeep slowly drives towards him and Fry gasps.]
# Fry: That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! [Screaming, he runs and pushes Enos out of the way of the slow-moving Jeep, which turns right before it gets to them.] Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
# Enos: I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
# Bender: Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
# Enos: You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox? [He reaches into Bender's head and takes out some microchips.] Ooh! Snacks!
# [He puts them in his mouth and winces as he chews.]
# Bender: Hey! That's my brain!
- - You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox? Ooh! Snacks!
  - Hey! That's my brain!
# [An atomic bomb goes off.]
# [Cut to: Shack. Enos looks at the picture of the man but is distracted by the glow coming through the window.]
# [Cut to: Desert. The shockwave tears the shack apart. In the Jeep, Fry looks in the mirror and sees the mushroom cloud. He stops and looks back.]
# Bender: And you are outta here!
# [Scene: Mildred's Bedroom. Fry and Mildred are asleep in bed. Farnsworth, Leela and Bender peer through the window and are disgusted. Leela wretches.]
# Bender: [from outside] Oh, my God!
# Farnsworth: Choke on that, causality!
# Bender: [shouting] 1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
# [Time Lapse. Fry searches the area with a metal detector.]
# Leela: Anything?
# Fry: No. [The metal detector beeps.] Wait!
# [Leela slams her spade into the ground and it hits Bender's head.]
# Bender: Ow! Stupid junk!
- - He's alive! Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
  - I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
- - Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?
  - Amen!
