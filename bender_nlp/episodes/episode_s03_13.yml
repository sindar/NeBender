conversations:
# [Scene: New New York City Street. Fry and Bender walk down a busy street and Bender sings and dances.]
# Bender: [singing] Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,
# Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!
# Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--
# Fry: Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! [He opens the packet and Bender eats one. Something clangs around inside of him and he shits a brick. Then some.] There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
# [Sal dumps another scoop-ful and amongst the dirt is an entire VW minivan. Fry gasps.]
# Bender: What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
- - Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
  - Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.
- - Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.
  - What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
- - Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.
  - OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
# [Bender attempts to open the Mobil Dick Whale Oil and walks towards the can opener and the magnet grabs him and starts cutting into him. Sparks fly from him and he sings.]
# Bender: [singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
# [He screams in pain.]
# Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
# [He screams in pain again. The rest of the staff cringe and cover their eyes.]
# Fry: Oh, no!
# Bender: [singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
# Cause the master's gone away.
# [Scene: Cedars-Sinewave Robot Hospital. Bender lies on a bed and a doctor checks him over. He has huge gashes across his chest.]
# Bender: Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
# [The doctor sighs.]
# Doctor: This is the worst part of the job.
# Bender: What is it, good news?
- - Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
  - You mean--
# Fry: Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.
# Bender: [crying] Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
- - Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?
  - Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
# Patch Cord Adams: Hey, here's a giggle! [He plugs himself into a Jokebook Computer and downloads some jokes.] Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?
# Fry: No, why?
# Patch Cord Adams: 'Cause it always locks up.
- - Hey, here's a giggle! Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard? No, why? Cause it always locks up.
  - For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
# Patch Cord Adams: Well, so long. Get well soon. [He looks at Bender's medical notes.] Oh, well, so long anyway.
- - Well, so long. Get well soon. ... Oh, well, so long anyway.
  - Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
# [Everyone except Fry leaves.]
# Fry: Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
# [Bender bawls and Fry leaves. The sound of a harmonica stops his tears.]
# Bender: Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. [The doctor draws back the curtain and reveals the head in a jar of Beck. Beck wears a futuristic harmonica holder around his neck with little arms that move the harmonica back and forth in front of his mouth. The doctor pulls a mask over his face and welds Beck's jar to the neck of a life-sized dummy. Beck stops playing.] Wow, that was great.
- - Hey, thanks. You a fan?
  - I dunno. Let me see. ... Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
- - Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
  - Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
- - So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
  - Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
- - Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
# [He motions the doctor to him and whispers something to him. He takes the harmonica holder out of Beck's jar and puts it around Bender's neck.]
  - What's this for?
# Beck: Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. [Bender struggles and strains as he tries to move the little arms on the harmonica holder.] Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic. [Bender starts moving the arms with ease and scrapes them across his scarred chest.] Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.
- - Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. ... Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic. Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.
  - Why? Cause I can make annoying noises?
- - Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player.
  - Alright! Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
# [Scene: Outside Planet Express. The staff are gathered outside the building by the side of the road. Fry, still wearing his headband, wheels Bender out on a sack truck. He has a small green suitcase with him. A large blue bus pulls up and the horn honks.]
# Bender: Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.
# All: [singing] Where it's at!
# [Bender scrapes his chest.]
# Bender: [electric voice] Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
# Beck: Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.
# [Bender hears something and turns around and sees some broken robots in some bins, rolling towards a building.]
# Bender: Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
# [He waves.]
# Robot #1: I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here.
# Robot #2: You rock!
# Fembot: Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me.
# Robot #3: Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.
# Bender: Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be-- [He is interrupted by the sound of machinery in a building grinding up the robots and turning them into paperweights.] That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
- - Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.
  - Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be--  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
- - Whoa, dog. Just cold chill. You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?
  - Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like "odelay".
- - Odelay is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.
  - Ooh!
# [Scene: Beck's Bus. The bus drives down a desert road with the VW behind it. Inside, Beck lies on a couch while Bender writes.]
# Bender: I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. [A man offers him the book.] No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
- - I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
  - Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!
- - We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
  - And we could call it "Bend-Aid", after me, Bender!
- - And you can sing that song you're writing!
  - And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me - Bender.
# [Montage: The bus passes through several more states as Bender tries to come up with a song. He dabs his eyes with a tissue as he reads the song. At another concert, Fry, Zoidberg, Amy and Leela rummage through dustbins for food. Fry finds a hotdog with mustard and flies and holds it up to the others. Zoidberg cuts it up into four pieces and they eat it. They arrive in San Francisco at dusk.]
# [Scene: Sir Francis Drake Hotel. Bender sits on a bed in his hotel room, writing his song.]
# Bender: Alright. "Hands in the air" rhymes with "Just don't care" and ... finished! [He sniffs.] Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!
- - Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
  - Alright, but hands off the minibar.
# [Everyone cheers.]
# Fry: Yeah!
# Zoidberg: Hooray, robot!
# Amy: Bender, you're famous!
# [Bender wipes away a tear.]
# Bender: Yeah.
- - Hooray, robot!
  - Yeah.
- - Bender, you're famous!
  - Yeah.
# Leela: This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
# Bender: [crying] Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now: I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised. [He stops crying and stands up.] That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, "Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".
- - This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
  - Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now - I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised. That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, "Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".
- - Bender, you can move! You're cured!
  - Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
# [Time Lapse.]
# Bender: I can move again. [crying] My music career is over.
# Fry: Bender, I don't claim to understand "the biz" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
# Bender: [crying] No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. [He gasps and stops crying.] Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
- - Bender, I don't claim to understand "the biz" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
  - No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
# [Bender and Beck hit the stage and liquid spills out of Beck's jar.]
# Beck: [singing] Can't you hear those cavalry drums,
# Hijacking your equilibrium...
# Bender: Whoa-oh, yeah!
- - Can't you hear those cavalry drums,
  - Whoa-oh, yeah!
# [Cylon and Garfunkel walk onto the stage with a big cheque.]
# Garfunkel: Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000.
# Cylon: It's been an emotional day for me.
# [They prop it up next to Bender and he starts to cry.]
# Bender: [crying] I don't know what to say.
# Beck: Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys.
# [The band starts to play Bender's song and the lights dim.]
# Bender: Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ... [The broken robots cheer.] ... this is a song called My Broken Friend.
# [The crowd cheer.]
# (singing) People say my broken friend is useless,
# But I say his mind is free,
# There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,
# Beck: Kick it!
# Bender: [singing] He could make a good...
# Bender: and [singing] ...hat-rack
# Beck: [singing] He only has to stand there,
# Bender: [singing] Or a cheap...
# Bender: and [singing] ...doorstop,
# Beck: [singing] He doesn't need to move
# Bender: [singing] Or a great big...
# Bender: and [singing] ...giant Thermos,
# Bender: [singing] With a twist-off top,
# Beck: [singing] That would be good for soup,
# Bender: [singing] He could be a storage closet...
# Bender: and [singing] ...for outdated pants,
# Beck: I like 'em tight!
# Bender: [singing] My broken friend could do it all,
# Bender: and [singing] Just give him a chance!
# Bender: [singing] That robot has a tragic secret,
# That I'd like to share...
# Beck: For real?
# Bender: [singing] ...My broken friend is closer to me,
# Than an ass to a chair...
# Beck: Hm.
# Bender: [singing] ...That robot's name I never told you...
# Beck: Who's that?
# Bender: [singing] ...You could not foresee...
# Beck: C'mon, give it up.
# Bender: [singing] ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
# Bender: and [singing] His name is you and me.
# [Bender dances.]
# Bender: [singing] Don't melt me down into a crowbar,
# Beck: [singing] It suffers alone,
# Bender: [singing] Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,
# Beck: Hey.
# [The robots look around and Bender flails his arms and legs around.]
# Bender: [singing] Or toss me into a trash can...
# Beck: Bender, what are you doing?
# Bender: [singing] ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
# Beck: What are you doing?
# Bender: [singing] ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
# Beck: Yo! What's the dealy-o?
# Bender: [singing] ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
# Beck: Hold it! What? No!
# Bender: [singing] ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
# Beck: B-Bender.
# Bender: [singing] ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
# Beck: No!
# [Bender bounds off across the stage.]
# Bender: [singing] I'm telling you, my broken friend...
# Beck: Cut it!
# Bender: [singing] ...Can do 'most anything!
# [He slides across the stage on his knees.]
# Beck: Cut it!
# Bender: Yeah!
# Beck: Cut it!
# [The crowds shouts and "boos". Bender's harmonica holder falls off. He looks at himself.]
# Bender: Curse my natural showmanship!
# [Scene: San Francisco Street. The VW flies down the road, pursued by Beck's bus.]
# [Cut to: VW. Bender looks in the rear-view mirror.]
# Bender: Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
- - Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
  - Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
# Leela: And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
# Fry: Is any of that a problem?
# Zoidberg: Not if you've lived a life without regret.
# [He screams. The VW flies off the edge of the road and plummets to the ground below.]
# Bender: I'll save me!
- - And I forgot this isn't a hovercar. Is any of that a problem? Not if you've lived a life without regret.
  - I'll save me!
- - Quick, grab his footcups.
  - Hey? What? No.
# [Scene: Fisherman's Worf. The fat guy from the Titanic and a thin woman buy some food from Tarty McTang's and they hear Bender screaming from above.]
# Bender: [shouting] Someone fat get in my way! [He lands on the thin woman and squashes her. He gets up and staggers away. Beck's bus rams him and knocks him over. Beck, Cylon and Garfunkel get out. Bender groans.] [talking] I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.
# Beck: Good.
# Bender: I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
- - Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted.
  - So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
# Garfunkel: Over my dead career!
# [He takes the cheque out of Bender's chest cabinet.]
# Bender: Well, it was worth a shot.
- - Over my dead career!
  - Well, it was worth a shot.
- - C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
  - Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.
# [He takes a magnet from Ye Olde Tourist Trappe and puts it on his head. His pupils go wild and he starts to sing.]
# Fry cracked corn,
# And I don't care,
# Leela cracked corn,
# I still don't care,
# Bender cracked corn,
# And he is great!
# Take that, you stupid corn!
