# Bender: [shouting] Ow, my head! My precious head! [Leela quickly turns the can opener off and Bender edges away from it.] [talking] Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!
- - You alright, Bender?
  - Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal.
- - Don't yell at Nibbler like that. You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up.
  - No.
- - I said pet him.
  - I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands! Ow! My ass! Get off!
- - Are you alright?
  - Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
- - Not you. Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
  - Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.
- - It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.
  - What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
# - - No-- What? Huh?
#   - Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
# Leela: No!
# [She rips Bender's arm off and smacks it against the table until it lets go of the broken bottle.]
# Bender: You about done?
- - Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
  - I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape. # [sarcastic]
- - Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
  - Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. ... And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?
# Amy: Hey, look at Nibbler!
# [Nibbler is sat in a high-chair at the table and chews a spoon.]
# Hermes: Aww, he's holding a spoon.
# Zoidberg: He's so talented!
# Bender: You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. [He takes off his head, whistles Sweet Georgia Brown and spins his head like a Globetrotter then reattaches it.] Ta-da!
- - Hey, look at Nibbler! He's so talented!
  - You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. Ta-da!
# All: [singing] What day is today?
# It's Nibbler's birthday,
# What a day for a birthday,
# Let's all have some cake.
# Fry: [singing] And you smell like one too!
# [He giggles and they all applaud.]
# Bender: Hey, what about this?
- - Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
  - Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
- - Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
  - So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
# Bender: That'll take care of those annoying rats. [He puts it back in the cupboard.] Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
# Bender: There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. [He turns around and washes his hands. While his back is turned Nibbler hops around the worktops and starts sniffing the cake. Bender turns around and sees.] No! Get away from there! [Nibbler gobbles up the cake and Bender screams. Nibbler burps.] That's it.
# [Scene: Planet Express: Bathroom. Bender carries Nibbler in holding him by his eyestalk and lifts the toilet seat lid.]
# Bender: Happy birthday!
- - Bender, what's going-- No!
  - Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
- - Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
  - Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
- - Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
  - Only one way to find out.
- - You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
  - Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
# - - You do?
#   - Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
- - Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fianc√©e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
  - Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
# Linda: [on TV] The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000.
# [Bender sniggers and Fry, Hermes and Zoidberg grab him and pin him to the table. Farnsworth unscrews his head.]
# Bender: Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
# Farnsworth: I need to tinker in it.
# Bender: Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
- - I need to tinker in your head
  - Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
- - And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions? Yes. If by "allow" you mean "force".
  - Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
- - Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more.
  - Ow! Professor!
- - Steady now.
  - Ow!
- - There we go. Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
  - My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
# Zoidberg: That's me, baby!
# Farnsworth: Hmm.
# [He turns the chip again.]
# Bender: Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
# Amy: Uh ... that's me.
# Bender: This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
- - Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
  - Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
- - I'm not mopey. You shut up!
  - Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
- - What's your problem?
  - I miss Nibbler.
- - You do? # miss Nibbler
  - Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?
# Bender: Uh-oh, jealousy. [He stands up and points at Fry.] [shouting] You think you're so hot!
# Fry: What?
# Bender: The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
# Bender: [crying] I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. [He walks off.] [crying] A bucket of--
- - The spoon's in the foot powder.
  - I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
- - Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers.
  - Really?
- - Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
  - Hmm, sewers. Thinking, thinking, thinking.
# [Scene: Planet Express: Bathroom. He stands in the toilet.]
# Bender: Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. [He flushes the toilet but doesn't go anywhere.] Damn, it's too small. [He climbs out of it.] What did those human design this for anyway? [He disconnects his left arm, drops it down the toilet and flushes it away.] Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! [He spins his head off and flushes it.] See you on the other side!
# Leela: Wait, what's that?
# [They shine their torches down the tunnels and see Bender at the other end trying to reattach his limbs. He has put his right arm in his right leg socket and his right leg to the right arm socket. He groans.]
# Bender: I never should have thrown out the manual.
- - Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
  - I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
- - He was so cute.
  - He was so sweet.
- - Nibbler?
  - Nibbler?
- - Idiot
  - Idiot
- - Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
  - You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
- - It must be wonderful.
  - Eh
# Raoul: Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me. [He opens an umbrella and Fry, Leela and Bender follow him, covering themselves.] All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium. [He points at a fish tank with eight fish and a yellow bird floating dead on the top.] This is our library.
# [The library is just a shelf. Bender looks at what is on offer.]
# Bender: Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
# [He holds up Atlas Shrugged.]
- - Nibbler?
  - Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
- - No. That's just an urban legend.
  - Then what are those?
- - Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
  - Hey, yeah!
# Vyolet: Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
# [Bender laughs and Leela looks sad. Bender's chip beeps and he groans.]
# Bender: Oh, I made myself feel bad.
- - Quiet! The beast approaches.
  - Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious! Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
- - That's not El Chupanibre.
  - Say what?
- - Bender, do something.
  - I'm too scared.
- - I can't. I love every living creature.
  - Listen to me, Leela - I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
- - Well, I could use a new tank top.
  - Bigger! Bigger!
- - A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
  - Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
- - Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
  - Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
- - Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
  - No, thanks!
- - And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
  - I love you too. Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
- - No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
  - And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
