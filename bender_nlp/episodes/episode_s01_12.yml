  - OK, now you go hide. Nice knowin' you.
# Bender: OK, everyone, come and get it!
# [He opens his door. He has turned his chest cabinet into a grill and there are four cooked burgers on a wire rack. He takes one out and puts it in a bun and hands it to Fry. Fry takes a bite.]
- - Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
  - Bite my red-hot glowing ass. #... Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass? ... I'll be right back! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Aw, yeah!

  - Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!
- - Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
  - Right here, buddy. Wait, I wanna be in the picture too. Pretend you're happy.
# Bender: Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
# Leela: The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
# Bender: Evidently not.
- - The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
  - Evidently not.
- - Well, you heard the windbag - We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
- - A what?
  - You know, a coward.
- - Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
  - It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity. Oh, crap!
- - We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black. You're brown. And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together. Am I right, soldier?
  - Well, actually, I-- Sir, yes, sir! Sir!
- - W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
  - Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!
- - Bender, damage report.
  - The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
- - We did it! We won!
  - Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini. ... Well, who wants a martini?
- - That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
  - Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned.
- - Check this out - Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
  - They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
- - Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
  - And I, I could be an acting coach!
# Bender: [singing; on TV] Single Female Lawyer,

# [Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar.]
# Bender: [singing] And being self-reliant.
# (talking) Hey, I'm pretty good!
# Fry: No, no! Go to commercial!
# [Bender puts the Single Female Lawyer card in front of the camera.]
# Bender: We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
# [He retracts his eye.]
- - You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
  - Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?
# Fry: And ... cut!
# Bender: [singing] Single Female Lawyer,
# Having lot's of sex--
# (talking) Huh?
# Bender: You did it, Fry!
# Fry: Yep. [He turns the TV on, sits down on the couch and puts his feet up on the table.] It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows: At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal.
