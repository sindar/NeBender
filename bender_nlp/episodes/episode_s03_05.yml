# Leela: Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
# [Fry takes out a small pack marked "Top", opens it, takes something out and puts it in a machine. He throws the packet on a pile of other packets. He rips open another pack marked "Bottom" and puts it in the other side of the machine. He rips open another pack marked "Middle", puts it in the middle of the machine and pulls a lever on the machine. The machine compresses the cookie sections and makes a cream filled cookie. He pulls it apart a licks out the cream from the middle. Bender sprays his antenna with something and slicks it back.]
- - And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--
  - Thank you.
- - But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
  - So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
- - That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
  - Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
- - No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
  - Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!
# [Scene: The Planet Express ship beeps as it back up and docks with the Juan Valdez, using a tow bar.]
# [Cut to: Ships Cockpit.]
# Bender: Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.
# - - I am at ease.
#   - Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!
- - The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
  - I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
- - Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
  - Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table
# [Scene: The Planet Express ship flies past Saturn with the tanker still in tow.]
# [Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. A table tennis table has been set up as a dining table. Bender and Fry are in the middle of a pasta meal.]
# Bender: But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.
# [Zoidberg, sitting at the other end of the table across the net, claps.]
# Zoidberg: Brilliant!
- - Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!
  - Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
- - Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
  - Eh, I've heard better.
- - If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
  - Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
- - Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
  - Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
- - You can drink with me maybe?
  - I don't feel like drinking.
# Zoidberg: Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. [Bender walks through it.] Three.
# [Scene: The ship and tanker fly past Neptune, Urectum and Charon and head for Pluto.]
# [Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Bender is sober and his face is covered in five o'clock rust. He lies back in the pilot's seat and looks like he is about to slide of as he steers the ship wildly.]
# Bender: [singing] Oh, Greenland is a barren land,
# A land that bears no green,
# Where there's ice and snow,
# And the whale fishes blow,
# And the--
# [Enter Zoidberg with a bottle of Olde Fortran.]
- - Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
  - Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either. I'm a good captain.
- - Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal - Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
  - Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?
- - I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!
  - Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
# Bender: Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!
# Leela: Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? [She runs her finger over a penguin's black feathers.] And clean the black parts too.
# [She walks off. Bender mocks her. Smitty and URL look at some penguins.]
# Smitty: Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
# URL: It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!
# [They hug.]
# Bender: Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? [He sees them hugging.] Oh, ho! What's this?
# Bender: What the--? [The penguins and he dive into some water. Bender comes up to the surface.] What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!
# Penguin #1: [in penguin] Full of fish?
# Bender: [in penguin] Not entirely.
# Leela: Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. [She looks down the gunsight.] But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look. [She shakes as she starts to squeeze the trigger. A tear streams down her face. She shoots and the penguins squawk and run away.] [crying] Oh, no! What have I done? [She runs down the hillside. The penguins are gathered around a dead penguin. Leela falls to her knees and cries.] Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? [Bender opens his eyes and resets to Human Mode. He loads the human language and brings up his task list. 1:Bend. 2:Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
- - Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
  - Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo! Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
- - Aw! They love you!
  - Well I don't love them. I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
# Penguins: [in penguin] Stand still. It's our only hope.
# Bender: [in penguin] That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
# Waterfall Sr.: Hey! Where'd they--
# Bender: [shouting] Attack!
# [He and the penguins stand on a ledge behind the hunters. They slide down head-first towards the hunters. Leela dives out of the way and the penguins swarm the hunters.]
# Hunter #1: Whoa!
# Hunter #2: Ow!
# Bender: [in penguin] We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
- - They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
  - Yep. It's like I taught 'em - If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!
# Leela: Oh, if only we had a toboggan.
# [She looks up and down at Bender.]
# [Time Lapse. They both slide down the mountain.]
# Bender: Faster! Faster!
# Leela: Phew!
# Bender: Oh, phew! [The penguins dive into the water and swim towards the ice block.] Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
- - It's Fry!
  - Wiggles?
- - Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
  - Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?
- - Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
  - Oh, and bring my toboggan.
- - Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?
  - Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.
