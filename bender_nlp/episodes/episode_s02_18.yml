# Bender: [singing] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! [He walks into the room. Leela and Amy read magazines and Fry looks at a copy of Playbot. Bender dances.] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
- - Oh, no! Someone you know must've died.
  - I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck! Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir.
- - Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
  - Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated! C'mon, it'll be fun!
# Bender: Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?
- - And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle.
  - Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
- - On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
  - Oh, man, there's always a catch!
# Bender: Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--
- - What is it?
  - That painting, the eyes are watching me!
- - Hmm. It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
  - So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although-- What's that?
# - - I don't know, but it's infectious!
#   - No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
- - Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago.
  - The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
- - 0101100101 What does it mean?
  - It's just gibberish. 1010011010?
# Bender: Uncle Vladimir!
- - Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!
  - That's what they said about being alive.
# Bender: [screaming] Nooo!
# Fry: Bender, wake up! [Bender mumbles as he starts to come around.] He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
# [Everyone offers him some. Bender takes a hip flask from Amy.]
# Leela: Bender, what happened?
- - Bender, wake up! He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor? Bender, what happened?
  - Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
- - Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!
  - Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
- - Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
  - Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
- - Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby.
  - Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this - I scared! # [crying]
# Bender: Where--? What the--? [He tastes it.] Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
- - Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!
  - Please, I'm scared.
# Bender: I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet.
- - Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
  - No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
- - Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
  - You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
# Bender: Damn the expense!
- - My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!
  - Phew!
- - For, you see, you are a were-car.
  - A were-car?
- - The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
  - I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
- - Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
  - I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
- - Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- - According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car.
  - I'm with you.
- - In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse.
  - And otherwise I can never die?
- - Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
  - No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
- - There. No rampaging for you tonight.
  - Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
# Bender: Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?
- - Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
  - I tried to run you over?
- - It was very sweet of you, Bender.
  - Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
# Fry: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
# Leela: Cursed, got it.
# Bender: Whatever.
- - Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful - Many robots are stupid and violent.
  - I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--
# Yokelbot: Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers.
# [He pokes Bender with his pitchfork.]
# Leela: We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
# [They dive on the robot and punch him.]
# Yokelbot: Stop! What are ye doing?
- - Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers. Stop! What are ye doing?
  - We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
- - Ye think me be he?
  - Si # SÃ­.
- - Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
  - Let's kick him some more.
- - No, wait, let me explain. It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
# Calculon: Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!
# Fry: Look, are you the original were-car or not?
# Calculon: No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.
- - No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.
  - Give us a name, MacButt!
- - You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
  - Psst, there it is.
- - Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
  - Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
- - Oh, no! It's midnight.
  - Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
- - Take whichever one you want.
  - Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!
- - Whoa!
  - Uh-oh.
- - Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
  - I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
- - Bender, I'm alive! You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. Here's to you.
  - Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
