# Leela: Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. [She pulls the dipstick out of the ship and looks at it.] [shouting] We're OK on Coke syrup.
# [Bender puts an Ethanol & Tonic pump into his mouth and use his fingers as a lighter to light a cigar. His fingers won't work though.]
# Bender: Oh, man! Come on! [Leela pushes the dipstick back in. Bender suddenly explodes and his head flies past.] Comin' through!
# Bender: What's that black cracker?
- - I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
  - Well there's always hope. C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
# Bender: Who are you?
- - Scruffy. The janitor.
  - Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
- - Schedule conflict.
  - There! Fixed forever.
# Zoidberg: That's normal. Next patient.
# [Sawing sounds come from the pipe and it suddenly breaks off leaving a hole through Fry's body. Bender peers through the hole. It suddenly fills itself in. Everyone gasps.]
# Bender: He's a witch!
- - Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Guess again.
  - Go, man! Go!
- - It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
  - Oh! Ew!
- - Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
  - Shotgun!
- - In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!
  - Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?
# Bender: 'Ello! What's all this then?
# Bender: Sorry you struck out, sausage link.
# [Cut to: Fry's Bedroom.]
# Bender: If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
- - Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
  - There you go! Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
