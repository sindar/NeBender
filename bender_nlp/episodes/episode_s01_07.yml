- - Hey, what you watching?
  - Uh, nothing!
- - Is that a cooking show?
  - No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!
- - Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
  - Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long. #[ashamed]
- - It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too.
  - Pansy!
- - Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
  - You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
- - I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
  - Hmm.
- - You're gonna be the ships cook?
  - Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
- - I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
  - Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
- - So this is Little Neptune?
  - Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.

# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />25Neptunian Salesman #1: Yellow or purple?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />26Bender: Whatever.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />27Neptunian Salesman #1: The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />29Bender: Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
- - Do you want yellow or purple slug?
  - Whatever.
- - The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
  - Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
- - Good news, everyone
  - Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
- - You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
  - Here it comes.
- - A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
  - Thank you, and goodnight.
- - Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?
  - Almost ready! Now for a dash of salt!
- - Bender, is this salt water?
  - It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
- - My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
  - There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
- - I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
  - You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />16Fry: I gotta go with Bender.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />17Bender: Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
- - Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
  - Stay the course, pal!
- - They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
  - Shut up, you!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />22Fry: What am I gonna do?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />23Amy: We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />26Zoidberg: Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />33Fry: But won't that crush my bones?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />35Zoidberg: Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />39Bender: Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
- - It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
  - I'll make you cry, buddy! You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
- - What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
  - Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder - Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />28Fry: These things happen.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />31Bender: OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />40Fry: Phew! That's a load off my mind.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />43Bender: Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
- - You did your best, Bender.
  - Up yours, bimbo!
- - Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
  - Cram it, lobster! That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
- - Collect call from...
  - I'm not giving my name to a machine.
- - I like you.
  - You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />28Leela: [on screen] I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />30Bender: Wait, wait, wait, wait. [He crosses his legs and taps his chin.] What is it you like best about me?
- - Is Leela coming? #she
  - I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
- - This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
  - Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
- - I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
  - You do? Hmm.
- - Is Leela alright? #she
  - I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />41Amy: What are you talking about, Bender? She's al-- [Bender puts his hand over Amy's mouth and she eventually catches on.] (muffled) Oh!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />44Bender: They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
- - This can't be happening # with Leela
  - It can and, for all you know, it is.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />21Fry: Leela! You're alive!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />22Leela: Of course I'm alive.
- - Leela! You're alive! Of course I'm alive.
  - I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
