conversations:
- - Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called "Cannibalon"!
  - Me neither. Food was good, though.
- - Oh, great news, everyone.
  - Shove it! We quit!
- - In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
  - Alright!
- - It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
  - Aww, you!
# Leela: Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
# Zoidberg: You know Zapp Brannigan?
# Leela: Let's just say we've "crossed paths".
# Bender: Was that before or after you slept with him?
# - - Let's just say we've "crossed paths".
#   - Was that before or after you slept with him?
- - Ah, here's my stateroom.
  - Come on, where is it?
- - Well at least we get a window!
  - Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
- - Snake eyes.
  - No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
# Bender: Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
# [The bartender, iZac, turns around.]
# iZac: You got it!
# [He fills a bucket. Bender turns around and sees the Fembot from earlier. He gasps and walks over to her.]
# Bender: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
# Countess: Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
- - Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
  - I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word "labour".
- - Oh, Mr. Bender!
  - Please, call me Bender.
- - Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
  - I was just about to suggest the same thing. Pay dirt!
- - Lovely, isn't it?
  - Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
- - Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!
  - I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
- - It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.
  - Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
- - Hey, you gonna pay for those?
  - Hell, no!
- - Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
  - Fellas, please. I'm in love!
# Bender: Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
- - Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
  - You do? Really?
- - Come on, before it's too late!
  - You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
- - You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
  - Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
- - I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
  - I love you, buddy!
- - I fell through the deck.
  - Are you hurt, my sweet?
- - No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
  - Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
- - Bender, you risked your life to save me.
  - And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
- - Well, now what are we going to do?
  - Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
- - Goodbye, Bender.
  - Wait for us!
- - I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
  - I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
- - No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
  - Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
# - - Farewell!
#   - No!
# Bender: She's gone.
# Farnsworth: Oh, yes, absolutely! [He turns to Zoidberg.] Not a chance!
# [He draws his finger across his neck and mimes being hung.]
# Bender: At least I'll always have her bracelet! [He hands it to Hermes.] What do you think it's worth?
# [Hermes takes a look at it.]
# Hermes: It's fake, mon!
- - It's fake, mon!
  - Nooooooooooooooooooo!
