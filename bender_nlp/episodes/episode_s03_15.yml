# [He holds up a mirror and Smith sees his reflection.]
# Smith: [on TV] No! [He turns to the seat next to him.] Eva Braun! Help me!
# [She takes of her facemask, revealing she is a human-fly. Smith screams. All of the Planet Express staff except Fry sit watching the TV.]
# Bender: Saw it comin'!
# Fry: Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own.
# Amy: Big deal!
# Bender: We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
- - Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own.
  - We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
# [The ship cruises towards the edge of space and lands in a parking space. The crew get out and walk to a wall separating space from the whiteness after it. Fry puts some money in some binoculars and looks through them. He sees a Planet Express crew from a parallel cowboy universe wave. He and the others wave back.]
# Fry: Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
# Farnsworth: No, just the two.
# Fry: Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.
# Bender: I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
- - I've only got two fantasies left - Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
  - I could pound your head till you think that's what happened.
- - Onto the Internet you go!
  - Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers.
- - Oh, dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you.
  - Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Leela breaks the news to Fry.]
# Leela: She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
# Bender: [shaking his fist] Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!
- - She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
  - Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. Bender sits in a chair and impersonates Archie Bunker from All In The Family.]
# Bender: What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!
- - But Fry's our friend, Bender.
  - Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?
# Leela: You stifle, Bender.
# Zoidberg: Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
# Leela: Although he is completely right.
# Bender: We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
- - You stifle, Bender. Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him. Although he is completely right.
  - We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
# [Scene: Nappster HQ. Enter Bender, Leela and Zoidberg.]
# Bender: Who's in charge of this dump?
- - That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.
  - Listen, you fat Internet nerd.
- - Listening.
  - Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
# Liu: Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years.
# Zoidberg: The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium.
# Bender: So what's your problem?
- - Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years.
  - So what's your problem?
# Liu: Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us. [Someone downloads a copy of her and she fizzles and screams.] [crying] It hurts!
# [Jervis knocks on the door.]
# Jeff Jervis: [from outside] Open this door! Don't make me call the maintenance guy.
# Bender: It's a bluff!
- - Open this door! Don't make me call the maintenance guy.
  - It's a bluff!
- - Thanks for rescuing me. Especially you, Bender. Mmm. Quite a masculine piece of metal, aren't you?
  - Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
# [The Liubot gets up and moves towards Leela. She kicks her in the face and trips her over. Leela gets up.]
# Leela: Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!
# [She kicks her and the two fight. Leela gains the upper hand and kicks the Liubot against a fire hydrant.]
# Bender: Then along came Bender.
- - Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!
  - Then along came Bender.
- - That was incredible, Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
  - Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior! It's an army of Lucy Lius!
- - Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots.
  - Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
# [The Liubots eat their way out of the popcorn and spit the kernels at the projector room like machine gun fire. Everyone screams and ducks.]
# Bender: You'll be safe in here, sweetheart. [He opens his chest cabinet and takes out another head.] Get lost, Pavarotti!
# [Tears well up in Fry's eyes. The Liubot flickers.]
# Fry: I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot.
# [She does. Fry reaches behind her hair and presses the "erase" button.]
# Liubot: I'll always remember you, Fry-- [mechanical voice] Memory deleted.
# [Her image flickers away, leaving a battered blank robot.]
# Bender: I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
- - Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
  - Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!
# Liu: It's true. Bender and I are in love.
# Fry: But, but--
# Bender: Don't be a prude, Fry!
- - It's true. Bender and I are in love. But, but--
  - Don't be a prude, Fry!
