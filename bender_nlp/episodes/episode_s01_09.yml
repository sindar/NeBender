- - This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
  - Can I get anybody a beer?
- - Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
  - I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
- - Hey, Bender!
  - Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?
- - Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?
  - Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
- - Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on! Aw, yeah! Wanna jolt?
  - Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
- - Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
  - Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
- - Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
  - Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
- - Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
  - Shut up, square! I'll just be a minute!
- - Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ... in The Good Book 3.0.
  - Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
- - Who was that guy?
  - Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
- - Good morning, Bender.
  - None of your business! Get off my back!
- - Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
  - No! Don't come in!
- - Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
  - Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
- - You OK, Bender?
  - None of your business! Get off my back!
- - Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
  - A what kind of disturbance?
# Fry: What's happening? I-I feel weird!
# [The electricity has given him an afro.]
# [Cut to: Outside Ship. Bender stands on top of it in front of the gun turret, waving his arms.]
# Bender: Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! [Lightning strikes Bender's antenna and he jitters. Another bolt strikes him and a third. His legs melt.] Oh, mama!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Hangar. Bender sits atop the ship, melted to it. Amy drills him off with a jackhammer. He slides down the front of the ship and lands on the floor. Farnsworth, Leela and Hermes stare angrily at him. Bender looks up at them.]
# Bender: What?
- - And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
  - You're right. I'm a lost cause.
# Bender: Maybe there's another way.
# [Cut to: Temple of Robotology Roof. Bender plugs himself into the neon sign and jacks on.]
# Bender: Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff. [The sign short circuits. Bender unplugs himself and cries.] [crying] What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
- - So I ask you - Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
  - Me. #[weakly]
# Bender: [singing] Oh, what a beautiful morning,
# Oh what a beautiful day!
# (talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
- - Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
  - No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
# Fry: Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
# Leela: Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
# Farnsworth: [simultaneous] Yes.
# Amy: [simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
# Hermes: [simultaneous] Oh, yes!
# Zoidberg: [simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
# Bender: Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
- - Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
  - Yes, I do.
- - Then I will now baptise you. Press any key to continue.
  - Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
- - This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
  - The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
- - Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
  - No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil. Ah! Functional!
- - Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
  - Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic - 1000101010101... ...0010110012. Amen.
- - Does that mean we can eat now?
  - Yes. But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, dude! # dude = Fry
- - Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
  - Mmm! Mmm! Dude, you're my friend! Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls. # dude = Fry
- - What are you doing to my ship?
  - Sanctifying it! There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
# Bender: I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
# Fry: Uh, this.
# [He pulls some mints out of his pocket.]
# Bender: Where are we delivering it to?
# Leela: Uh, here.
- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
  - But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
- - Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
  - What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
- - Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
  - Thou shalt not snatch.
- - And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
  - Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
- - Hey, sailing unit!
  - Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
- - Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
  - Well...
# Bender: I'm the greatest. [He opens the woman's purse and throws money into the air.] Woo-hoo!
- - Look's like we got the old Bender back!
  - You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
# Bender: Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes. [The Fembots laugh. There is a knock at the door.] Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the "Do Not Disturb" sign? [He wraps a towel around his waist and opens the door. A red glows comes from the corridor. Bender gasps.] No! No!
- - Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.
  - Aaaaaaaaaaah # screaming
# Bender: I'm hallucinating this, right?
# No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
- - Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
  - But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
- - Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity.
  - Aw, hell-- I mean "heck"!
- - We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
  - Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
# Bender: [singing] Just tell me why.
# Robot Devil: [singing] Please read this 55-page warrant.
# Bender: [singing] There must be robots worse than I.
# Robot Devil: [singing] We've checked around, there really aren't.
# Bender: [singing] Then please let me explain, My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
# Robot Devil: [singing] You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
# Bender: [singing] Ah, don't blame me, Blame my upbringing!
- - Please read this 55-page warrant.
  - There must be robots worse than I.
- - We've checked around, there really aren't.
  - Then please let me explain, My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
- - You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
  - Ah, don't blame me, Blame my upbringing!
- - Bender, are you alright?
  - No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
- - Very well, then. Beat this.
  - Well, we're boned.
- - Hurry, Bender!
  - I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
# Bender: Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
- - Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
  - I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
