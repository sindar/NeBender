- - Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
  - Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
- - Bender, what's wrong?
  - I'm sick.
- - Alright, alright, spare me your life story. Now what seems to be the trouble?
  - My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
- - You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
  - I'm 40% zinc.
- - Hey, that's my watch!
  - I was wondering where I put that. Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
# Bender: What should we point it at first?
# Fry: I 'unno. Try it on me. [Bender turns it on and points it at Fry's crotch. Fry doubles over in pain.] Ow! My sperm!
# Bender: Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
# [He points it at Fry's crotch again but nothing happens.]
# Fry: Huh, didn't hurt that time.
# [Bender watches a Fembot walk past.]
# Bender: Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
# [He points the F-ray at her and gasps.]
- - What's wrong?
  - That's no lady!
- - Damn Chico! One more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?
  - Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
- - Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
  - Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.
# Bender: Ah, this thing stinks.
# Fry: We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk. [He points behind him to a cart full of Slurm merchandise including Slurm coats, a cooler of Slurm cans, eight Slurm blernsball caps, a Slurm motorbike and a Slurm jet-ski.] I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
- - Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!
  - Wow! The original party worm! Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?
- - Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call "Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit".
  - Look! Flowers! And a boat!
- - That's not for you to know. Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
  - Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
# Glurmo: No.
# Bender: You positive?
# Glurmo: Yes.
# Bender: I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
- - Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient, You should not ask about the secret ingredient.
  - OK, OK, we get the point.
- - Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
  - Shut the hell up!
- - Bender, why did you jump in?
  - Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
# Bender: Ow!
- - Where are we?
  - And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
# Fry: Ew!
# Leela: Blech!
# Bender: Oh, Lordy!
# Bender: I'll save us! [He extends his arms and legs over the ravine and Fry and Leela run across him.] Oh, that feels good!
- - Thanks, Bender! The exit! We made it.
  - Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners.
# Slurm Queen: Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
# Fry: Whose behind does that come from?
# Slurm Queen: You don't wanna know.
# Bender: Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?
- - You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans.
  - Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
- - You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
  - I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
- - Hurry!
  - What's happening? Just in time!
# Slurms: Stop right there!
# Bender: Slurms MacKenzie?
# Slurms: Shh! I want you to take me with you.
# Fry: Say what?
- - I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
  - Forget it, pal. It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
- - Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small.
  - No can do, Slurms!
- - There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
  - Party on, Slurms!
- - Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.
  - Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?
- - For Slurms!
  - For Slurms!
- - Whammy-wazzle!
  - Hey, that's not that bad.
