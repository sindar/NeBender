# Leela: [shouting] We're back from the mission!
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Fry leans over the railings.]
# Fry: Wh-What? You went without me?
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room.]
# Bender: [shouting] You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.

  - You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
# Fry: But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar.]
# Leela: Don't worry. Everything went fine.
- - But-- But I'm the delivery boy. Don't worry. Everything went fine.
  - Better than usual!

  - Nope.

  - Nope.
- - Bender's great--
  - Nope! #[He groans.]
# Fry: Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.
# Leela: Nope. [She closes her locker door.] I've got a date with Chaz.
# Fry: Chaz?
# Leela: I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.

- - I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
  - Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!
- - Um, OK. Let's go bowling.
  - Nah.
- - Bender, would you do the honours?
  - With gusto.
