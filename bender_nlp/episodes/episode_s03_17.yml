conversations:
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. Hermes, Bender, Leela, Fry, Scruffy and Amy are gathered around watching the TV.]
# Linda: [on TV] Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool.
# Bender: Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
- - Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool.
  - Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
# [Leela uses the remote to change Bender's volume control to maximum.]
# Linda: [on TV] Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers.
# Bender: More like three lockers and a sink!
- - Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers.
  - More like three lockers and a sink!
- - Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
  - Of course not.
- - One puny human got a look at the robber...
  - Here we go. Here we go!
- - Describing him as a short, nasty, muscular...
  - Yeah, make me famous, big head!
- - Caucasian human male.
  - What?
# [He takes Fry's beer bottle and throws it at the TV.]
# Fry: Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
# Bender: This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
- - Well, there's the material rewards.
  - You mean this junk?
# Bender: [crying] All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name. [hoarse] It's Bender.
- - Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
  - It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.
# [Cut to: New New York City Street. Bender walks sadly down the busy street.]
# Bender: How does a nobody like me get famous? [He sees a mailbox and gasps.] I know! [He puts his foot in it.] Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!
- - You're not stuck.
  - Shut up.
# [Time Lapse. Bender sees a group of roller-skaters ahead of him dancing. Skates come out of his foot cups and he starts dancing.]
# Bender: Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
# [Time Lapse. Bender comes to the end of the street and sees a white, windowless building ahead of him. He gasps.]
# Bender: A blank wall! Fame is mine!
# [He runs towards the building, takes his head off and shakes it like a spray-paint can. His legs extend upwards towards the top of the building and he chuckles as he starts to spray something onto the wall.]
# [Time Lapse. The next morning, Bender stands back and admires his work. He has sprayed a huge picture of himself onto the wall, along with "Bender Lives Large And Kicks Butt!"]
# Bender: There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
- - Alrights, ladies, let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!
  - No! #[screaming]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Attic Room. Bender enters the darkened room, lit only by light streaming through the window.]
# Bender: I'm the first one to work. A new low.
- - Happy funeral, Bender!
  - A surprise funeral? For me?
# [Fry pats him on the shoulder.]
# Fry: We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
# Zoidberg: [opening the coffin] Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
# [Bender climbs in.]
# Bender: Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
- - We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered. Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
  - Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
- - Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk.
  - Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
- - Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
  - It's what made me me.
- - If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
  - Eh, the Professor's was better.
- - Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead.
  - Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
- - Oh, Danny-boy, The pipes, the pipes are calling--
  - Who-y-boy?
- - From glen to glen and down--
  - Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.
- - I'm expressing my sorrow.
  - Get lost! I'd say "Don't quit your day job" but you're awful at that too.
- - We're trying our best.
  - Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!
- - Bender was a truly special--
  - Louder and sadder. #[shouting]
- - Bender was a truly special--
  - Next! #[shouting]
- - Dear Lord--
  - Oh, next!
- - Oh, Danny-boy--
  - Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
- - Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this - Bender was my friend.
  - What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! [He pushes his legs through the bottom of the coffin and stands up.] I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
# Osiran: We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
# [Fry laughs.]
# Fry: Also Wolfman!
# [Bender whistles, impressed.]
# Bender: Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
- - We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
  - Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
- - Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
  - Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him. I think I'm gonna like it here!
# Bender: Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?
# Osiran: Good idea, slave. [He whips Bender and counts quicker.] One-half, pull! [He whips them.] One-half, pull!
# [He whips them.]
# Bender: Now we're slavin'!
# [Time Lapse. Back at the bottom of the tomb, they pull another block.]
# Bender: Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. [He pushes a block up the side of the tomb and the Osiran runs after him, whipping as he goes. He stops to catch his breath.] You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
- - Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
  - I'll tell you who I remember. ... Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
- - Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
  - Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
- - Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
  - Viva Hermenthotip!
# Hermenthotip: And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby--
# [The nose falls off the tomb and crushes him. The slaves gasp.]
# Bender: [screaming] No!
- - Tell the slaves they can all go--
  - Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
- - No. I mean they are all free--
  - Free-loading off you? I agree.
- - Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
  - He's whippin' angels now.
- - We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking! Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
  - I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!
- - Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
  - Wow!
# [Scene: Wall of Prophecy. Bender sneaks around to the front of it and takes a hammer out of his chest cabinet.]
# Bender: We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
- - The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are "here" and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some ... tents.
  - Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!
- - We hear your voice, oh, great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us.
  - Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
- - People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
  - Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
# [The crowd cheers then realises what he has said.]
# Leela: What did he say?
# Bender: Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ... [The priests gasp.] ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
# [The slaves are whipped.]
# [Scene: Bender's Statue. Fry and Leela crawl along the floor with Bender sat on a throne on their backs. An old slaves struggles as he pulls some logs.]
# Bender: Lowly slave, why are you not working?
# Slave #2: I am.
# Bender: I meant yourself to death.
- - Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.
  - Well then what do you think you should stop doing? Crawl, pigs!
# [They crawl forward.]
# Bender: The Pharaoh has spoken.
# [Scene: The statue is almost finished. The foot is positioned so it looks like it is about to crush Hermenthotip's tomb. Up in space, the slaves, in spacesuits, lift Bender's antenna ball to the top of the statue. Bender floats near them wearing a jet pack.]
# Bender: Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
- - Does it please you, my lord?
  - Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?
- - But, sire, we made it to your exact specifications.
  - Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
# High Priest: Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died.
# [The slaves cheer and the priests throw Bender into his tomb.]
# Leela: Good riddance.
# Bender: [shouting; from tomb] What about my servants?
# Priest: Oh, yeah.
# Fry: Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!
# [Bender pulls some bandages away from his face.]
# Leela: You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
# Bender: I wanted to watch you remember me.
- - You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
  - I wanted to watch you remember me.
- - Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
  - Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
- - Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
  - Sorry, but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes. Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
- - It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
  - No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
# Leela: Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot "Bender"?
# [She nudges him.]
# Fry: Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. [Bender gasps.] Did you hear something, Leela?
# Leela: No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
# [Bender hits his head.]
# Bender: Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line.
- - Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot Bender? Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. Did you hear something, Leela? No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
  - Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line.
- - Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?
  - Oh, please, let it be me.
# Fry: That guy who used to bend things. You know?
# Bender: Me, please!
# Fry: Hermes.
# Bender: Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.
- - That guy who used to bend things. You know?
  - Me, please!
- - That guy who used to bend things. You know? Hermes.
  - Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.
# [Cut to: Osiris 4 Surface. The statue starts to shake and the foot splits apart. Bender, Leela and Fry run through the hole and past some slaves.]
# Slave #1: Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living.
# Bender: [running past] How we doing?
# Statue: Remember me.
# Bender: [crying] I will. I will.
- - Remember me.
  - I will. I will.
# [Scene: The ship speeds away from Osiris 4 and the statue explodes, sending a shockwave across the desert.]
# [Scene: Ships Cockpit. Leela comforts Bender.]
# Bender: Please, just leave me alone.
- - Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that.
  - I don't? #[crying]
- - No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument.
  - You really think they'll remember me?
# Fry: Absolutely.
# Bender: Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
# [Scene: The ship flies towards a planet.]
# Bender: [from ship] Set course for Earth!
# [He cackles.]
# Leela: [from ship] That's not Earth.
# Bender: [from ship] Oh.
