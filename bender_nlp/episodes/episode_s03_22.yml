conversations:
- - Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
  - Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends.
- - Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
  - Okey-dokey!
# [They make for the door. It opens and Bender is standing there stirring a bowl of slop.]
# Bender: Fleeing somewhere?
- - With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
  - In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. The staff sit around the table and Bender dishes up.]
# Bender: Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. [Everyone gasps. The pony leg on Amy's plate still has a horseshoe on the hoof.] Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
# [He takes a cloth out of his lab coat and puts his hand in the wormhole and wipes the food from off his head. Enter Bender, humming. His antenna pop-ups and dings like a microwave. He takes something green out of his chest cabinet.]
# Bender: The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
# [She scrapes her food into a plant and sits down. Bender doesn't notice. He walks back towards the kitchen, humming. He notices the dead plant.]
# Bender: Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!
# Bender: [crying] And this time I mean it.
# [He ticks "And This Time I Mean It".]
# [Scene: Outside Planet Express. Bender walks away from the building with a bindle over his shoulder. He throws his chef's hat down and squeaking rats run out of it.]
# [Scene: New New York City Street. Bender walks down the street still crying.]
# Bender: Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that. [He cries then looks up. He is standing outside Elzar's restaurant.] Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!
# [Scene: Elzar's Fine Cuisine: Kitchen.]
# Elzar: Absolutely not.
# [Bender has his arms wrapped around Elzar's legs.]
# Bender: But I watch your show. You owe me!
- - I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.
  - What was the first one again?
- - I hate you.
  - I thought that was number two.
# [Scene: Rooftops. Bender sits on some pipes. He has five o'clock rust.]
# Bender: [crying] It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
- - Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.
  - What did you call me?
- - A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
  - Oh, OK. I thought you said romo.
# Dandy Jim: We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land.
# [They jump and the train hits the prism and each truck flies off in a different direction.]
# [Cut to: Planet Surface. The hobos roll when they land and Bender lands on his head.]
# Bender: Ow.
- - Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
  - I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
# Gus: Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
# Dandy Jim: His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
# Gus: Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
# Bender: Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
# [Spargle is a small, bald man with a German accent. He sighs.]
# Spargle: Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
- - Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
  - Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
- - Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!
  - That twizzler!
- - As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes.
  - My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
- - Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.
  - It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.
- - You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
  - I could?
- - Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
  - Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
- - Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking.
  - Done.
# [Scene: Bumbase Alpha. Spargle is seated at a table with hobos and robos gathered around. Bender walks out of a hut carrying a tray with a cover on it. He hums and puts the tray on the table in front of Spargle.]
# Spargle: Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal. [quietly] Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age-old secret [whispering] of perfect flavour.
# [The crowd gasps.]
# Gus: Ooh, yeah!
# Bender: [shouting] Slop's on!
# [He lifts the lid.]
# Gus: Fine lookin' eats!
# [Spargle takes a bite and Bender looks on with anticipation. Spargle chews and the crowd stares. Spargle swallows.]
# Spargle: It is ... acceptable.
- - Fine lookin' eats! It is ... acceptable.
  - Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?
- - Because ... my stomach is about to explode.
  - What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!
- - Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone. And using this, you cannot fail.
  -  A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
- - No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth. Oh! There goes my ... life.
  - I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!
# [Scene: Elzar's Fine Cuisine. Bender meets his opponent.]
# Bender: Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
# Elzar: Why, you--
# [Bender knocks a spice weasel off Hattie's table and turns to Elzar.]
# Bender: Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says [hoarse] "Ooh, I'm dead!"
- - Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
  - No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
- - OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
  - Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
- - Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
  - Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron! You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under "Dr. Bender".
# [Time Lapse.]
# Hiroki: And now, Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today.
# Bender: [quietly] If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish à la king; if it's turkey, fish à la king.
# [Bender hammers his food and arranges it on a tray. He looks at it and then takes out Spargle's vial.]
# Bender: Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.
# [Leela crosses her fingers.]
# Koji: Challengeruu Benderuu!
# [Everyone applauds.]
# Fry: Yay!
# Farnsworth: [shouting] That's my robot! I own him!
# Bender: You honour me, Chairman Koji.
- - Challengeruu Benderuu!
  - You honour me, Chairman Koji.
- - Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
  - Chairman-san, I came here with one goal - To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that.
# [On the other side of the studio Elzar scrubs the pots and pans.]
# Elzar: No question.
# Bender: But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of "Zinc Saucier", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. The staff watch the show on TV. Bender turns it off.]
# Bender: And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
- - Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
  - The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... "confidence"?
