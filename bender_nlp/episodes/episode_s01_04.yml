- - Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
  - That sounds like a cry for help.
- - Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
  - A saucy puppet show.
- - So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
  - Forget it, he's gay.
# - - What? How can you tell?(he is gay)
- - What? How can you tell?
  - I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />16Leela: There's no such thing.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />18Bender: No? [He pulls out a machine with a small antenna on it from his chest cabinet. The antenna swivels around.] OK, I got a lock on him. [The machine beeps.] Yep! He's gay!
- - There's no such thing like gaydar.
  - No? OK, I got a lock on him. Yep! He's gay!
# Are you sure?
- - Are you sure he is gay?
  - Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
- - This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
  - I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
- - I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
  - Can do!
- - So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
  - Why two? ... Oh!
- - I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
  - That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />31Leela: Do you mind?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />33Bender: Here you go. [He pulls out a fork.] You can use this as an eye-poker.
- - They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
  - A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />01Fry: [teasing] Leela's got a boyfriend!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />03Leela: No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />07Bender: Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you. [He holds up the fork.]
- - What just happened?
  - He's throwing us in prison.
- - Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
  - You really are too picky.
- - We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
  - Hey, yeah!
- - You wanna try escaping again?
  - Nah, I'm comfy.
- - Hello, there. Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
  - So, you're saying we can cook him?
- - No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him. Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
  - Aww! I'll fire up the grill!
- - I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
  - He's pending for a bending.
- - Prepare for lift-off. We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
  - Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
- - No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
  - So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. Oh, my God!
- - Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
  - Can do!
- - I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
  - So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
- - We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
  - So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
