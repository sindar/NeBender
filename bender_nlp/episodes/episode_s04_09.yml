# [Scene: Outside Gummer's Cafeteria. Farnsworth lands the ship in a disabled space and they get out.]
# Bender: Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?
# Leela: Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old.
# Amy: Right on.
# Fry: Yup.
# Bender: Uh-huh!
- - Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old.
  - Uh-huh!
# Fry: He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
# [Bender pushes Heather away from the pump and rolls up his sleeves.]
# Bender: Step aside, lady. [He starts pumping.] Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending. [He pumps harder and the tar starts bobbing around. It throws Farnsworth up and down. The staff watch.] [mean voice] C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder! [weak voice] I'm trying as hard as I can. [mean voice] Harder, damn you!
- - I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
  - I'm tired of your yapping. [He rides into the room on a motorbike and knocks over a table.] All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
- - Fine! Get going!
  - Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all Where's Bender? I miss Bender.
- - We won't know that until you leave.
  - Oh, I'm leaving!
- - There's the door.
  - I'll be good.
- - It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or "RNA".
  - Question.
- - Yes?
  - You stink!
# Farnsworth: [shouting] The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
# [Everyone cheers and runs in.]
# Amy: Let's go!
# Bender: [sarcastic] Yes, everyone do the same thing!
- - The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber. Let's go!
  - Yes, everyone do the same thing!
# [Scene: Outside The Turangas' House. Leela opens her bedroom window and starts climbing out.]
# Leela: Until she sneaks out!
# [She climbs out and starts up the ladder after the others.]
# Bender: When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
