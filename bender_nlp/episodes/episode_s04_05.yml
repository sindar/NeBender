# Fry: Who are you, old man?
# Old Man Waterfall: Name's Old Man Waterfall but most folks just call me "Old Man".

# Fry: Ow!
# Bender: What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?
# Zoidberg: None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. [shouting] Glob!

  - It's already 10 o'clock!
# [Leela checks her watch.]
# Leela: Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
- - Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless.
  - I know I am.
- - Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine.
  - Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.
- - Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
  - Wow! Ow!

# Bender: Hey, I need that to smoke!
