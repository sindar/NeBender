conversations:
# [Scene: Fry's and Bender's Lounge. Bender stands in front of a mirror wearing a black top hat and purple cape. Fry wears a snazzy, yet revealing, leotard. Bender clears his throat and addresses the mirror.]
# Bender: For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... [He rolls his arms up.] ... and nothing in my head. [He takes his head off shows it to his "audience" and replaces it.] So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk... [He rolls up a newspaper and pours the milk into it. He then unrolls the newspaper.] Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
- - Amazing! That's why they call you "Bender the Magnificent"!
  - No, it isn't.
- - Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at.
  - Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious.
- - Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
  - You lived before you met me?
- - Sure. Lots of people did.
  - Really?
# [Scene: Museum of Natural History. Fry and Bender walk down a corridor to the exhibit past displays such as "Codpieces of the Federal Reserve Chairman", a pimp in amber and "Coprolites of the New York Knicks". Bender hums and they walk into the pizzeria exhibit. They look around.]
# Bender: Truly, they were as gods who built this place!
# [Flashback ends. Bender reacts to the fossilised dog.]
# Bender: Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff sit at the table.]
# Bender: And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.
- - Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
  - Nah, protesting never works.
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. Bender the Magnificent has sawn Dr. Zoidberg in half. Although his feet look oddly human.]
# Bender: Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
# [Scruffy and Leela applaud. Zoidberg jumps out of one half of the box.]
# Zoidberg: I was all in this part! It's magic!
# [Bender beats him with his wand with each word.]
# Bender: You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
# [Enter Farnsworth, Fry and Seymour.]
# Fry: Good news, everyone!
# Bender: Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
- - Good news, everyone!
  - Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
# [On the screen an arrow points to a yellow blob inside Seymour.]
# Fry: So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
# Farnsworth: Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death.
# Fry: I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
# Bender: Crappy ineffective Reaper!
- - I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
  - Crappy ineffective Reaper!
# [Scene: Fry's and Bender's Kitchen. Fry takes a bag of Kibbles 'n' Snouts out of a brown paper bag and puts it into the cupboard next to a box of Cocker Floss. Bender walks in and notices a dog collar on the side.]
# Bender: A dog collar, for me? [He puts it on.] You shouldn't have!
- - That's for Seymour.
  - Oh.
# [Cut to: Fry's and Bender's Lounge. Fry unloads two more bags of Kibbles 'n' Snouts. Bender walks in, carrying the toy.]
# Bender: Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? [He puts on some glasses.] That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
- - Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
  - Are you on the junk, buddy? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence? #buddy = Fry
- - Hey, he was smart! He could fetch.
  - I can fetch.
- - He could dig up bones.
  - Hello? Charlemagne? Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
- - Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
  - That's impossible!
- - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
# [Bender looks at a kennel and walks out. Fry holds a hammer and a sign saying "Seymour" ready to nail on.]
# Bender: No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says "Bender" on it. [Fry hammers the sign on but the hammer head flies off and hits Bender.] Ow!
  - No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says "Bender" on it.
# [She drags Amy out of Fry's way. Fry kicks the mat out of the way and puts Seymour's bed on the floor next to the couch. Enter Bender and a Robo-Puppy.]
# Bender: Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
# Fry: [indifferent] That's nice.
# Bender: I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
- - Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
  - Jealous? Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
- - Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
  - Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?
# [He pulls on a rope and a drill moves towards Seymour. Enter Bender the Magnificent.]
# Bender: Fry, c'mon, the talent show!
- - What? I'm in the middle of something.
  - But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
- - Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
  - So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!
# [He picks up Seymour before the drill bit reaches him and throws him into the molten lava.]
# Leela: No!
# Zoidberg: Oh!
# [Seymour sinks and Fry gasps. Bender laughs and hugs him.]
# Bender: Now I'm all you got!
- - I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! ... Ow!
  - So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
- - Then all hope is lost. Goodbye, Seymour.
  - Please stop crying, buddy. Here. I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done? #buddy = Fry
# [He starts to cry.]
# Zoidberg: You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
# Bender: Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. [He looks into the lava.] I'm goin' in!
- - You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
  - Buddy, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. I'm goin' in! #buddy = Fry
- - I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
  - I'm 40% dolomite! Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!
# Fry: This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. [He cries. The ground starts to shake and Bender erupts through it with Seymour.] Bender!
# Bender: And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent! [His eyes melt and fall out.] Hey, where'd everybody go?
# [Time Lapse.]
# Bender: OK! Let's clone us some dog!
# Fry: Yeah!
# Fry: Stop the cloning.
# [He picks up a spanner and hits the Clone-O-Mat with it.]
# Farnsworth: Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
# Bender: Fry, what's wrong?
- - Stop the cloning.
  - Buddy, what's wrong? #buddy = Fry
- - Think about it - Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
  - But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
