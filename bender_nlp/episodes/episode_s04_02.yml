- - Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela Orphan of the Year.
  - Alright!
- - And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
  - Neat!
- - Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
  - Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
# [Farnsworth sneezes and the nose flies off and lands on Bender's face. The lights come back on and everyone stares at Bender. He looks around.]
# Bender: [snuffed] Where'd it go?
# Farnsworth: Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.
# Hermes: I'm afraid I do. [He takes out his Federal Bureaucracy badge and Farnsworth gasps.] I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
- - Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it. I'm afraid I do. I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
  - 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.
- - Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?
  - Let's find out.
# [He swipes the card across his mouth.]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Attic Balcony. Bender holds a waste hose.]
# Bender: Alright, environment, you've met your match!
# Smitty: Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface.
# Vyolet: But he ruined my wedding dress.
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Balcony.]
# Bender: Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
- - Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface. But he ruined my wedding dress.
  - Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
# Leela: I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
# Vogel: There we are. Picture's up.
# Bender: [shouting] It's crooked!
- - There we are. Picture's up.
  - It's crooked!
# Fry: Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
- - Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
  - My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
- - Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
  - Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down-
# [Scene: New New York City Sewers. Fry, Leela and Bender are tied up and suspended over a pool of green sewage.]
# Bender: [shouting] What did I do to deserve this?
# Raoul: Let the punishment commence!
# Leela: Punishment?
# Fry: No fair!
# Bender: Bender's innocent!
- - Let the punishment commence!
  - Bender's innocent!
# Raoul: The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him! [He points at the leg mutant who sighs.] Allow me to demonstrate!
# [He pulls a lever and a rat is lowered into the sewage. It comes back up as a green pig with fins and bat wings. Leela and Bender groan and Fry wretches.]
# Fry: It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
# Raoul: Submerge the prisoners.
# [The crew are lowered towards the sewage. Bender panics then stops.]
# Bender: Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
- - The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him! Allow me to demonstrate!
  - AAAAaaaaa... Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
# [Two hooded figures emerge from the crowd.]
# Hooded Figure #1: [shouting] Turanga Leela!
# Leela: Who said that? How do you know my real name?
# [The hooded figures climb onto the crane holding the crew over the sewage and turn it so they are no longer suspended over the lake.]
# Bender: Whee!
# Raoul: They went this way!
# [The crew stop outside a building that appears empty.]
# Bender: Quick! In there!
# [Cut to: Building. The trio dust themselves off and look around. Leela sees a wall full of newspaper clippings and things to do with her.]
# Leela: Great Cheech's ghost!
# Bender: What's this junk?
- - Great Cheech's ghost!
  - What's this junk?
# [Fry sees a news clipping.]
# Fry: That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
# Leela: And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
# Bender: And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
- - That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage. And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
  - And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
# [The mutants approach the building.]
# Vyolet: [from outside] They must be in here.
# Raoul: [from outside] Yeah, after them.
# Bender: And then Bender ran!
- - They must be in here. Yeah, after them.
  - And then Bender ran!
# [The hooded figures emerge from the crowd again. One taps Raoul on the shoulder and whispers to him.]
# Raoul: Oh, very well. [He turns to the mutants.] Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
- - Oh, very well. Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
  - Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?
- - Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
  - Yeah! What are you chicken?
- - They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
  - Ew!
# Mutant #2: Move it, you ugly normals!
# [He forces Bender onto the plank and it wobbles. Bender looks down.]
# Bender: Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
- - Move it, you ugly normals!
  - Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
# [He pulls a unicycle out of his chest cabinet and cycles along the plank. Fry and Leela climb on and quickly move across. Leela stops at the bottom of the ladder. The airship sails back down. Bender opens the manhole and he and Fry climb out. Leela, still on the ladder, looks back down.]
# Fry: [from outside] Come on, Leela. You can do it!
# Bender: [from outside] Hurry! We're missing our bus!
# [Leela climbs the ladder but looks back down again at the hooded figures. She closes the manhole.]
# Fry: [from outside] Whoa! What are you doing?
# Bender: [from outside] I'm gettin' on the bus!
- - Come on, Leela. You can do it!
  - Hurry! We're missing our bus!
- - Whoa! What are you doing?
  - I'm gettin' on the bus!
# [Scene: New New York City Sewers. Leela chases the hooded figures through the tunnels but loses them where some pipes intersect.]
# Leela: Where did they go?
# [Some rubbish falls on her from above. She looks up through a grate and sees Bender.]
# Bender: Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
# Leela: [crying] You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you. [They hug.] This is the happiest moment of my life.
# [They cry. It rains.]
# [Cut to: New New York City Street. The "rain" is Bender emptying a spittoon on them.]
# Bender: Aw!
