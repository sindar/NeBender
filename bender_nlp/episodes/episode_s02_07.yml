- - Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!
  - Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
- - I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
  - You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory.
# Hermes: Anyone spend the night together?
# [Everyone except Fry and Amy replies "No".]
# Amy: Yep.
# Fry: Kind of.
# [Everyone gasps.]
# Bender: What?
# Amy: We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
# Fry: And it led there again when we got home.
- - We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another. And it led there again when we got home.
  - Congratulations, Pal, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.
- - Bender! Romance isn't about money.
  - Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
- - You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
  - Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
- - $500 and time served.
  - Stupid anti-pimping laws! Well, pay the man!
- - Bender, honey, we love you!
  - Shut up, baby, I know it!
# Bender: Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head".
- - Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
  - Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
# Bender: OK, Mister...?
- - Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.
  - Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
- - Let's see ... Oh, yes! Yes, definitely. Oh, I'd like some of that. Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu.
  - Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier. Say hello to Miss Right!
- - So, how's business?
  - Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.
- - Yeah, it's pathetic alright! How much?
  - 500 bucks.
# Bender: Zapp Brannigan OK?
# Leela: No!
# Bender: 600.
# Bender: I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
- - I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
  - Buddy, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl! # buddy = Fry
- - She seems a little old for me.
  - She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
- - Wheels fell off my house.
  - Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
- - Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
  - Eight bucks.
- - But you just said--
  - Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
# Bender: Leela, meet your future husband Sal.
# Sal: Nice eyeball, eyeball.
# Leela: Nice ass, ass.
# Bender: Ooh, sparks! [whispering] Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
- - Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
  - Of course not.
- - Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
  - Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
- - Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
  - Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I? # maybe chanfe Leela for something
- - No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
  - True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
# Bender: My ass! My beautiful ass!
