conversations:
- - Dinner ready?
  - Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!
- - Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
  - Problem solved - You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. Work his gut; I like it
- - Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
  - Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.
- - I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
  - I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?
# Bender: [tempting] Not even if they're saut√©ed in a little mud?
- - Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
  - What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
- - Well? How are they? Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!
  - You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
- - Look! Here's more!
  - The planet's covered with 'em.
- - Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
  - No, a whole Bender-ful!
- - They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
  - They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em "Tasty-cles".
- - We can't call them that.
  - Why not?
- - I know, we'll call them Popplers!
  - Good idea.
- - Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!
- - Good idea.
  - Bender's a genius.
- - Hey, business is great.
  - Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.
- - Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone.
  - Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
- - What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
  - Eat it or beat it.
- - Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto.
  - Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.
- - You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
  - Yes! I'm gonna be rich. You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
- - We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment. Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!
  - Or what?
- - No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu. The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain.
  - OK, we won't eat you.
- - Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
  - My booze!
- - Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
  - Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now.
# Leela: No!
# [Bender squeezes her mouth open and tips some Popplers into it.]
# Bender: I said "eat"! Come on, mange!
- - Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?
  - Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry.
# Bender: Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce. [The crowd murmurs and walks past him and into the restaurant.] Stop eating them with tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. [The Planet Express ship flies overhead. The bomb-bay winch doors open and a bomb flies out.] Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had! [The bomb bounces off the restaurant roof, onto Bender's head and onto the floor.] Ow!
- - That's her name, Philip.
  - Philip?
- - We're doomed!
  - Doooo...
# Bender: I'll miss you, Leela. [Leela is in a circus animal cage.] I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.
- - What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.
  - Just like titanium!
- - This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers. You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun. You both should be in here instead of me.
  - Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
- - Please, I'm creating. Voila!
  - Bingo!
# - - No!
#   - Bender: I can't look!
- - A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
  - Let's get drunk!
- - Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.
  - Here you go.
- - Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.
  - Who wants dolphin?
- - Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
  - Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
