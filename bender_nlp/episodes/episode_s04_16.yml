# Nixon: [on TV] My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!
# [The newsreel ends and the staff cheer.]
# Zoidberg: Money!
# Amy: I'm slightly richer!
# Bender: What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?

# [Scene: Hacking Jack's Fine Smokables. Bender peruses the fine merchandise within. He looks at some $1.99 Dutch Butts, then at a box of $25 Zubans, then the $300 Royal Kooparillo. He then sees a cigar in a glass case, Le Grand Cigar, which is $10,000.]
# Bender: Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?
- - Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest.
  - Give you 300 bucks for it.
- - No can do.
  - Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.
- - Very good, sir.
  - So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?
# [Cut to: Hacking Jack's Fine Smokables. Bender lowers himself from the roof Ã  la Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible and stops just above the case containing the Grand Cigar. He gets a diamond out of his chest cavity and cuts through the glass with it then throws it in the bin. He reaches in and takes out the cigar.]
# Bender: Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences.
- - This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi! And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!
  - You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?
- - Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap. Coffee time!
  - Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
- - Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!
  - Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?
# [Behind him the hobos cheer.]
# Dandy Jim: Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!
# Whitey: Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog.
# Amy: Yeah!
# Bender: Alright! Turkey dog!
- - Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog.
  - Alright! Turkey dog!
# Leela: At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
# Farnsworth: Oh, my, yes.
# Bender: Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson.
- - At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
  - Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson.
- - There he is!
  - Alright! Closure!
