- - I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
  - I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
- - I'll play.
  - I'm in!
# Leela: But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
# Ipgee: And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate.
# Bender: Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.

- - What's with the specs, Bender?
  - They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
- - It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
  - Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! Read 'em and leak salt water!
- - Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
  - If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
- - Let me see those glasses.
  - Um ... uh...
- - Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!
  - Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff.
- - No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
  - Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you? Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!
# Bender: Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
- - Great cow of Moscow!
  - Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
- - I'm going to jump!
  - Do a flip!
- - Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.
  - I get it, reverse psychology.
- - And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
  - Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
# Morgan: The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
# [She pulls it down and closes the locker. She opens Bender's locker. On the shelf is a nut. She picks it up and shakes her head.]
# Bender: [ashamed] Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
- - Bender, what happened to you? # !!! unsure if it is needed !!!
  - Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag. Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
# Bender: Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with-- [He gasps.] What the--? [He zooms in. Morgan is in bed with Fry. She holds the sheets up around her. Fry pulls the sheets up around him.] Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place: The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. [Morgan runs out with the sheets wrapped around her.] It's all coming together now!
# Bender: I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.
- - Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.
  - For I was blind but now I see!
# Bender: [from inside] The cat's out of the bag now!
- - Mr. Bender, about last night - That was just a ... a misunderstanding.
  - Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ... were having sex with you.
- - No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise.
  - That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say "You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it," and they'll say "Who, Bender? Who?" and I'll say "It was lovable ... old Bender."
- - I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.
  - I am Bender. Please insert girder.
- - Sing me home! When push comes to shove, You gotta do what you love, Even if it's not a good idea!
  - I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!
