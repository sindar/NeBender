# Linda: [on TV] Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite.
# Walter Cronkite's head: [on TV] Season's warnings, Linda and Morbo.
# Bender: This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
- - We're pushing as hard as we can.
  - Oh, pushing!
- - It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!
  - Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!
# Aide #3: Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!
# Fry: But you live in a gingerbread house.
# Aide #4: Hey! It's food or shelter, not both.
# Bender: You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
- - Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!
  - You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
- - Ha! No human could do all that.
  - Santa's right. We need some sort of robot. ... Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
- - Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
  - Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either. But that didn't stop me.
# Leela: Bender!
# [She takes it from him. Bender turns to the Neptunians.]
# Bender: Bow to your new Santa!
- - We are getting awfully tired, And we can't work any faster, And we're very, very sorry--
  - Why you selfish little bastards, Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?
# Aide #6: Ow!
# Bender: [singing] Then shut your yaps and back to work.
# Neptunians: [singing] Now it's very nearly Xmas,
# And we've done the best we could,
# Fry: [singing] These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
# Leela: [singing] And they're made from inferior wood.
# [She snaps the soldier in half.]
# Bender: [singing] I should give you all a beating,
# But I really have to fly.
- - Now it's very nearly Xmas, And we've done the best we could,
  - I should give you all a beating, But I really have to fly.
# Bender: [stupid voice] Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? [normal voice] I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? [stupid voice] Duh, OK!
# Girl: Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
# Mrs. Grant: This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer.
# Bender: No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
- - This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer.
  - No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
- - Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
  - But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
# Mrs. Grant: Go for the shins!
# [Bender runs back into the fireplace and scrambles up the chimney. The family hit him with metal objects and he cries out in pain.]
# [Cut to: Jeffery Grant's Rooftop. Bender emerges from the chimney with his legs completely battered. He crawls into the sleigh.]
# Bender: [groaning] One down...
- - Well, hello there, handsome! Won't you have a cookie?
  - Uh, don't mind if I do. Ow! What's in these things?
- - Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
  - Ow!
- - Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?
  - Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me.
- - At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanzaa tip.
  - Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
# Farnsworth: Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!
# [Bender lands in the fireplace.]
# Bender: Ho, ho-- [Farnsworth blasts Bender in the chest with a shotgun and he falls back.] Ow!
# Leela: [shouting] Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
# Farnsworth: [shouting] No!
# [He shoots Bender again and Hermes and Amy dodge.]
# [Scene: Planet Express Roof. Bender sits on the roof of the dome and unrolls his list of presents. He crosses off Farnsworth's name.]
# Bender: [crying] Oh, there's gotta be a better way.
# Bender: Bender, you're a genius!
# Vyolet: This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty!
# [She snorts.]
# [Scene: Alley. Bender sits leaning against a dumpster and holding a bottle of beer.]
# Bender: Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
- - Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?
  - Not Santa!
# Bender: Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
- - Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
  - And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
- - Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!
  - Hey, that guy said to tell you that--
- - Ah, good old Maggie! Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner.
  - But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
- - It is for the witnesses because it's not boring!  The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed.
  - Aw!
- - Stop the execution!
  - Leela!
- - You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus! Hey! Zero!
  - No! Not the magnets! Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home. Swing low, sweet...
# Bender: Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
- - I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas.
  - Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?
- - I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is - Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?
  - Well ... 'tis the season!
- - Let it snow!
  - Merry Xmas, kids!
# Bender: On, Trasher! On, Smasher! [The Kwanzaabot flies alongside.] Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?
- - Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai B'rith! You comin'?
  - Word!
- - By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice.
  - Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.
