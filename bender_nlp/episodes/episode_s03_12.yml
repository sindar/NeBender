conversations:
# [Scene: 7^11. Fry, Bender and Leela peruse the beer fridge.]
# Bender: Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
# Fry: How 'bout LÃ¶brau? It has dots on it.
# Bender: Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
- - How 'bout Lobrau? It has dots on it.
  - Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
- - I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
  - Baby wants a Zima!
- - Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?
  - You can brew your own beer?
# Leela: Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
# [Bender's head springs off.]
- - Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.
  - Yo!
# [He leans back so his chest cabinet is horizontal. Fry and Leela pour in the ingredients.]
- - Well, well. If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ... no pants and ... idiot!
  - We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
- - Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
  - Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? It's so beautiful.
- - Oh, bother! What have they done now?
  - Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
- - Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!
  - Lies! Lies and slander!
# [He belches foam.]
# Farnsworth: Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
# Hermes: You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
# [Bender rubs his hands together with glee.]
# Bender: Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
- - You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
  - Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
- - Get a job, you lazy kids!
  - I guess if you want children beaten ... you have to do it yourself.
# [A mail tube shoots out of the box and knocks Cubert off his feet.]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. Bender sits on the couch. His casing has expanded. Enter Fry and Leela.]
# Bender: I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
- - No, you have a healthy glow.
  - Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!
- - Ooh! Let me feel. Have you thought about what to name it?
  - I was thinking "Benderbrau" if it's an ale, "Botweiser" if it's a lager.
- - People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us.
  - Alright!
# [Enter Cubert and Dwight.]
# Cubert: Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!
# [The staff get up.]
# Fry: Yes, sir.
# Bender: Right away!
# Leela: We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
- - Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!
  - Right away!
# [He dives back in and gobbles scraps.]
# [Scene: Awesome Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch watching All My Circuits. Bender sings to his bump to the tune of the Mockingbird Song.]
# Bender: [singing] Hush, little brewski,
# Don't you leak,
# Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.
# [He rumbles.] (talking) Oh, my God! I think it's time!
# [Leela runs in.]
# Fry: Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.
# [Scene: Awesome Express: Meeting Room. Bender lies on the table with his head on Leela's lap. Fry puts the beer in bottles and Bender cries in pain.]
# Fry: Push, Bender, push!
# Leela: You're doing great!
- - Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs. Push, Bender, push! You're doing great!
  - It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
- - Almost there. Just two more bottles.
  - Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
# [The last of the beer drains from Bender. Fry holds a bottle up.]
# Fry: It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!
# [Enter Bender with a crate of Benderbrau.]
# Bender: Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies.
