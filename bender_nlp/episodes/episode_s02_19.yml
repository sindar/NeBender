- - Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.
  - Tough luck!
- - Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
  - Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
- - Do you think we should?
  - Yes, I do.
- - Woo, yeah!
  - Woo-hoo!
# Bender: Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
# Fry: That was great!
# Bender: And no one suspects a thing! [He laughs and gasps when he sees the rest of the staff standing angrily at the bottom of the steps.] Whoa! [A wall collapses.] And that's how we learned our lesson!
- - That was great!
  - And no one suspects a thing!
- - You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?
  - We're all very disappointed in you.
# Fry: What are we supposed to do for money? [He opens his wallet.] All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ... [He holds it up in a bag.] ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
# [In the photo the ski instructor has his arm around Michelle while Fry leans into the photo, waving. Bender unscrews his head and holds it out like a bucket to a passing man.]
# Bender: Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund? [Leela slaps his wrist.] Ow!
# [She puts his head back on.]
# Leela: We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
# Fry: Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
- - No, we can get jobs.
  - But we just had jobs!
# Bender: Hey, let's see what it says about me.
# [He takes a severed human arm out of his chest cabinet and Ipgee scans it. "Prime Minister of Norway" appears on the screen.]
# Ipgee: Welcome aboard, sir.
# Bender: Welcome to the future, human slave. [The man trembles and Bender laughs.] Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly! [He takes the cape and head off.] I'm a horrible robot! [The man backs into the freezer and Bender walks towards him, turning his head and outstretching his arms.] Kill all humans!
- - Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
  - Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
- - We have a cure for it now!
  - Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
# Old Man: Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!
# [Fry hands him the milk and closes the door. The old man freezes again. The door to the Probulator room opens and Bender walks out.]
# Bender: Stay beautiful, doll-face! [The door closes.] That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?
- - Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!
  - Stay beautiful, doll-face!
# Bender: Who should be unfreeze next?
- - No. No! Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
  - Alright!
- - I love this job.
  - Me too.
- - Showtime! I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
  - Boo?
- - Michelle!
  - Oh, my God!
- - Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
  - Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
- - Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
  - So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!
# Hermes: Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
# Fry: All what?
# Farnsworth: This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--
# Bender: A home invasion by a former roommate.
- - This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--
  - A home invasion by a former roommate.
- - Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
  - You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
- - But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
  - That's L.A. for you.
- - But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
  - He just won't stop with the social commentary.
- - Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
  - Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.
