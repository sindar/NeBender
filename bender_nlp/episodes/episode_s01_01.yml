- - Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
  - Bite my shiny, metal ass!.
- - is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
  - Bite my shiny, metal ass!.
- - It doesn't look so shiny to me.
  - Shinier than yours, meatbag!
- - Who are you?
  - my name's Bender!
- - You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.
  - Lousy, stinking rip-off! Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
- - Why would a robot need to drink?
  - I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!
- - What do you do, Bender?
  - I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
# - - You any good at bending?
- - You any good at it?
  - You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle - 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! 31. But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
# - - What they were for
- - What?
  - Suicide booths!  It was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
- - Wait! You're the only friend I have!
  - You really want a robot for a friend?
# - - Yeah, I wanted robot for a friend ever since I was six.
- - Yeah, ever since I was six.
  - Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
- - Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! Don't look! Don't look!
  - I'm not looking!
- - Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
  - Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
- - Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
  - I'll have to check my program ... yep.
- - C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
  - You're full of crap, dude! You make a persuasive argument, dude.
- - Come on, Bender! You can do it.
  - Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
- - Wait!
  - No, thanks.
# - - Good Lord! What is this?
#   - It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
- - It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
  - Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
# Fry: This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
# [Flashback. Fry skates with Michelle on the crowded ice.]
# [Flashback ends. The ice is gone, replaced with murky green waters inhabited by a green tentacled creature.]
# Fry: My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
# Bender: Wait! There's someone you know!
# [He points at Leela, standing with her implant gun.]
- - I've got no home, no family
  - No friends.
- - What is the matter with you?
  - I just wanted to be part of the moment.
- - Hey! He stole my ring!
  - Sorry. Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
- - Hey! You stole my ring!
  - Sorry. Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
- - I don't have an Uncle Fry.
  - You do now!
- - By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
  - Can we have some money?
- - Get those bums!
  - Well, we're boned!
- - Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
  - New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
