conversations:
# [Time Lapse. Bender picks something up at a toy booth.]
# Bender: Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!
- - And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out, Bender.
  - Please, I have some dignity!
# [Time Lapse. People walk into an auditorium that features the "Roboticon Annual Product Announcement". Bender, Fry, Leela and Farnsworth sit ready for Mom's speech. Farnsworth has a plaster on his head and Bender is holding the bottle and half of the spring.]
# Bender: The secret was scratching really, really hard!
# [The robots set Mom down and she starts to knit.]
# Mom: Hello, dearies.
# [The crowd cheers.]
# Bender: Woo! I love that old bat!
# [He pulls a sheet off something. Robot 1-X is a small, white robot with no legs nor any distinguishing facial features except for a large purple "eye". The crowd "ooh's" and Robot 1-X starts hovering. They take photos of it.]
# Bender: Neat!
- - Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
  - Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!
# [Bender climbs onto the stage with his bottle still in his hand.]
# Bender: Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.
- - Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
  - Man, that smells great!
- - Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?
  - Uh, I never got the change. Suckers.
# [Time Lapse. The crew are back among the stalls and booths.]
# Bender: That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!
# Farnsworth: Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
# [He holds up a blister-packed Robot 1-X. Bender presses his face against it.]
# Bender: [hoarse] Eep!
# Leela: Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?
# Robot 1-X: I can and will.
# [He sucks up the litter and dark matter, cleans the box and replaces it with fresh litter and a fresh pine scent.]
# Bender: Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
- - Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox? I can and will.
  - Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
# Leela: I asked you five minutes ago.
# [Robot 1-X picks up Nibbler, kisses him and puts him in the litterbox.]
# Bender: You call that a kiss? I'll show you! [He stands up and picks up Nibbler.] C'mere, Nibbler!
# [He kisses Nibbler and Nibbler struggles and squeals.]
# Farnsworth: Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
# [Hermes holds something.]
# Hermes: Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
- - Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
  - Yes, sir. I'm on it!
# [Scene: Planet Express Roof. Bender stands on the dome and nearly falls back but regains his balance. He starts welding the dish to the roof while Robot 1-X hovers nearby.]
# Bender: Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help.
- - Our owners asked me to assist you.
  - Yeah? Well assist this!
# [He takes a swipe at Robot 1-X but misses and falls off the roof. He screams as he falls. Robot 1-X quickly welds the satellite dish to the roof, and flies down to catch Bender.]
# [Cut to: Outside Planet Express. The staff walk out through the entrance just in time to see Robot 1-X catch the falling Bender. Bender groans.]
# Bender: When I screamed "help" I didn't mean you!
# Robot 1-X: I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life.
# [The staff applaud and Bender growls.]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. Fry, Farnsworth, Amy and Leela sit watching All My Circuits. Robot 1-X hovers next to Fry. Bender hops into the room in a dustbin.]
# Bender: Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
- - Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.
  - I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
- - Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
  - Never!
- - Why can't you accept his help?
  - I hate him.
# Leela: But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
# [Bender rolls around to face the crew.]
# Bender: I can't ask for his help because--
# [The staff turn to him.]
# Farnsworth: Yes?
# Bender: [whispering] I'm scared of him.
- - But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
  - I can't ask for his help because I'm scared of him.
# [Leela bursts out laughing then notices the rest of the crew aren't.]
# Leela: Oh, sorry.
- - Well then there's only one solution - You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
  - An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
- - Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
  - Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?
- - Yes! For God's sakes, yes!
  - Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
- - Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!
  - Yeah! Right on, nutcake!
- - I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
  - W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
- - I'm past that. Later, blood!
  - It's like he's not him anymore. You took away his robo-humanity. I changed my mind!
# [Scene: Outside Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Bender lands face down on a riverbank next to some seagulls. He sits up.]
# Bender: I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? [The seagull squawks.] I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it. [He cries and walks over to a "Boating Prohibited" sign, rips it down and folds it into a boat. He climbs into it and pushes it away from the riverbank.] And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner. [He sails away from the land towards and storm.] Oh, jeez!
# [Scene: The ocean waves roll and batter Bender's boat around.]
# Bender: [shouting] Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
# [Scene: Desert Island Beach. Day breaks and Bender finds himself washed up on a beach. He gets up.]
# Bender: Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. [He walks across the beach, lies down, picks up a rock and dumps it on top of him.] There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
# [He pushes the rock away and gets up.]
# [Time Lapse. On the beach, Bender has spelled out "HELP" in rocks but the last letter is unfinished so it looks like "HELF".]
# Bender: Damn. One rock short of rescue!
# [His message is a lot longer that "HELF". It reads "To Whom It May Concern: I, Bender, Bid You Hello! You Don't Know Me, Though You May Have Heard Of Me. But That's Not The Point. Long Story Short... I Need Helf". He walks off muttering to himself.]
# [Scene: Desert Island Cliff. Night has fallen. Bender stands on the edge of a cliff rotating his head. A light shines out of his eyes and he looks like a lighthouse. He makes a foghorn noise. The light goes out.]
# Bender: Oop! Low on power. [He chuckles.] Better fuel up! [The bottle is empty.] Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.
# [He falls to his knees and bursts into tears.]
# [Scene: Desert Island Jungle. Bender digs a hole.]
# Bender: Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
# [He takes a blender out of his chest cabinet and puts the yams in. He holds the plug and looks for somewhere to put it. He plugs it into a tree but nothing happens so he tries a beehive but still nothing.]
# [Time Lapse. He tries a wild boars nose. The boar growls.]
# Bender: Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
# [Scene: Desert Island Beach. Bender is back under his rock. He has developed five o'clock rust around his mouth and is muttering to himself. He sees a six pack of beer walking towards him and gasps.]
# Bender: Beer! [He throws the rock off him. The beer is a hallucination and is nothing more than six birds trapped in a six pack ring. Bender tries to pull one out and it bites him.] Ow!
# [He drops them and they run off.]
# [Time Lapse. Another night has fallen and Bender lies on his side on the beach. He hears drums and looks around.]
# Bender: Who ... is ... it? [A coconut drops on his head.] Ow!
# [He looks up and sees a cymbal-banging monkey in a tree. Three shadows creep over him and everything goes dark.]
# [Time Lapse. Next morning the unconscious Bender is fed something from a coconut half. He comes around and sees a Fembot, two robots and the monkey. The Fembot, Lisa, has a waterwheel in the middle of her body.]
# Bender: Who are you and why should I care?
- - Side A. We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here-- Side B. To live a simpler existence, free of technology.
  - A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
# [Cartridge Unit takes out a "Snappy Response" cartridge and puts it in.]
# Cartridge Unit: Your mother.
# Lisa: What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever. [Her wheel runs dry and she panics.] [screaming] Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end! [She runs down the beach and into the sea. The wheel refills and she walks out.] [talking] Anyway, we like it here.
# Bender: Like you have a choice. [He turns to the other robot, a Sinclair 2K.] So what's your problem?
- - Not enough... uh--
  - Memory?
# Sinclair: Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
# [Lisa's waterwheel dries out again.]
# Lisa: [screaming] Oh, God, no! I want to live! [She leaps into the water again then calmly returns to the group.] [talking] If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.
- - If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.
  - Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?
- - Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
  - That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
# [Time Lapse. The robots watch a snail crawling.]
# Bender: Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!
# [They high five.]
# Lisa: Yeah!
# Sinclair: Way to go!
# [The monkey bangs its cymbals.]
# Bender: That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party! [He takes a CD out of his chest cabinet and puts it in his mouth, which acts as a CD player. He starts dancing to Kenny Loggins' I'm Alright.] Yeah, baby! C'mon!
- - Where did you get that CD?
  - It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!
- - CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
  - Which ocean? That ocean? Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage. Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
# [Time Lapse. Next morning Bender swings in a hammock listening to the monkey banging its cymbals.]
# Bender: Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.
# Lisa: Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.
# [Sinclair and Cartridge Unit drag a washing machine up the beach. Bender gasps and runs towards it. He opens the door and looks inside.]
# Bender: Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- [He turns around and sees the robots staring at him. He stands up and closes the door and looks around at the simple beach huts and the mother boar feeding her children. He picks up the washing machine and throws it into the bay.] You--!
- - Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.
  - Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- You--!
# [He kicks it and hits it. The robots watch him and mutter.]
# Lisa: What? I don't understand.
# Sinclair: Is he alright?
- - What? I don't understand. Is he alright?
  - Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
- - But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.
  - Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function. But not for long!
# [Time Lapse. Night has fallen. Banging sounds come from inside a beach hut and Bender screams in pain.]
# Bender: [from hut] Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!
- - The downgrade is complete!
  - Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
- - Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity.
  - Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
# [The robots gasp. Cartridge Unit takes out a "What?!" cartridge and puts it in.]
# Cartridge Unit: What?!
- - What?!
  - We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
# [Cartridge Unit ejects the cartridge then puts it back in again.]
# Cartridge Unit: What?!
# [Scene: Night again. Under the sea, an oar-powered submarine glides through the water just above the seabed.]
# Bender: [from submarine] Row, comrades! Row!
# [Cut to: Submarine. Bender heads his crew who row while sitting in knee-deep water.]
# Bender: We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
- - We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
  - Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!
- - Did you see anything?
  - Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
# [Scene: Outside Submarine. The submarine surfaces and the crew climb out through the top.]
# Bender: And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
# Sinclair: Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
# [Cartridge Unit, Lisa and he cheer. The monkey bangs its cymbals.]
# Cartridge Unit: I'm for that!
- - Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
  - Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair. Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood.
- - Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you.
  - OK, fine. Fire!
# Leela: I'd better light some candles.
# [She claps her hands and candles around the room start burning. A rock crashes through the wall. The crew turn around and gasp. Bender climbs through the hole.]
# Bender: Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the "complicated" part I mean not the "lives" part.
- - Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?
  - I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.
# Farnsworth: That's just stupid.
# [Robot 1-X hovers next to Bender hitting itself with a sledgehammer.]
# Robot 1-X: Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?
- - Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?
  - I don't need your charity. Target Robot 1-X and fire!
- - You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!
  - Try again, Sinclair. I said target Robot 1-X!
- - Help us, wooden Bender!
  - Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something. What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!
- - Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also we're dying!
  - I'm a-comin' Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!
- - Sir, might I recommend--
  - You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
- - How may I help you?
  - Save my friends! And Zoidberg!
- - Hey, where's Bender?
  - Down here. I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
- - Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
  - Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like Save them! and he was all No problem! and then he did it--
# [Cut to: Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Bender is still on the machine. His whole experience was a dream.]
# Bender: This new technology is great! [The machine stops.] I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
# [Fatbot trembles.]
# Fatbot: It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea.
# [The technician shuts off the machine.]
# Bender: I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the-- [He looks around.] Hey! What's the dealy-o?
- - Your upgrade is complete.
  - But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
- - Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
  - Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
# Technician: No, get out. [He presses a button and the conveyor belt starts up.] Next.
# [Bender slides out.]
# [Cut to: Outside Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Bender walks out and watches three police cars chase another car down the street.]
# Bender: Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. [He crosses the road and walks down a flower-lined path with a white horse and lush trees nearby. He takes out a cigar and a fairy lights it for him.] Oh, thanks, baby!
# [He carries on walking and whistling through his imagination.]
