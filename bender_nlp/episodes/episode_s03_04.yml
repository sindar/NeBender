# Jockey: Hey, baby! Ever do it in a suitcase?
# [Cut to: Flushing Downs Grandstand.]
# Bender: Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race.
# - - Hey! What are you doing?
#   - This.
- - And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack.
  - That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
- - Well, someone's in a good mode.
  - Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race.
- - I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?
  - Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
# - - It is?
- - It is your full name?
  - Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez.
- - Here's the entrance. From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over.
  - He was fun.
- - Look, up ahead.
  - Old New York - The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
- - Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing. Howard Stern is overrated! Uh, oops!
  - New York is so burned.
- - 71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction
  - No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
# Bender: Ooh! That feels funny! [Fry and Leela climb onto him and he gets an intercom out of his chest cabinet and speaks into it.] This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
# [He makes a "bing bong" noise and sets off down the track.]
# [Scene: Newkirk Avenue Station Ruins. Bender stops at the station and Fry and Leela get off. A hobo is asleep on Bender's back.]
# Bender: Wake up, buddy. End of the line!
# Fry: Gosh! My old neighbourhood. [They walk down a deserted street and Fry points at things.] That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
- - On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
  - Was it poorly Xeroxed?
- - Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
  - Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place.
# Fry: This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
# Leela: And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
# Bender: What a waste.
- - This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter. And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
  - What a waste.
- - This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. I still remember the combination - Three. It's stuck!
  - The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me. ... There we go!
- - Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
  - You mean "breakfast club sandwich"?
- - Everything else in here held up OK.
  - Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
# Bender: Who is that God-like figure?
# Fry: It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
- - Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
  - Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
- - First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. And now he broke my hand!
  - His legend lives on.
- - So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
  - Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
- - Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
  - I'll get my kit.
- - Hmm. We lost Bender.
  - There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
- - It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?
  - You're twice the the he ever was.
- - Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.
  - Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
- - Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
  - Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
