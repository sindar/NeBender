- - Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
  - I thought you were retired.
- - Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
  - I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to "off".
- - Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry. Cherry! Mule. Crud!
  - So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
- - Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
  - That's for sure-- Roberto! Is that you?
- - Bender! Hey, man!
  - You old lunatic! How you been?
- - Not bad, not bad. Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!
  - Yeah, I'm doing OK too. I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
- - Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
  - Sure thing, pal.
# [He picks up the bag. Fry moves behind the plant.]
# Roberto: Hey, you! Red! [He cuts the top off the plant.] Quit watering that plant and get the door!
# [Fry runs for the door and kicks a woman on the way.]
# Bender: Well, nice talking to you.
- - Same here. You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
  - Hey, thanks, buddy!
- - I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
  - A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
- - Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
  - Yahoo! The system fails again!
- - I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
  - Well, you meet half the qualifications.
# Bender: [shouting] I find that offensive!
# [Bender sits with Fry.]
# Bender: Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
- - My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?
  - You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
- - Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!
  - Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon. Ah! Sweet light crude!
- - But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
  - Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
- - At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
  - Je suis Napoleon! No, seriously, I'm not.
- - Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
  - Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.
# [He stabs at the air and makes nutcase noises. Fry ducks and dodges the knife.]
# Fry: No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
# [Bender bangs from the next cell.]
# Bender: [shouting; from cell] Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
# [She holds Fry to her chest and he "beeps" faster. Nurse Ratchet pushes Bender in a wheelchair past the door. He sings and plays the banjo.]
# Bender: [singing] Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. [talking] Bonjour, y'all!
# Fry: [mechanical voice] Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.
# [He unzips his trousers, takes out two sandwiches and offers them to the others. They back away.]
# [Scene: Hal Institute Day Room. Bender tunes Norm's teeth with a screwdriver.]
# Bender: Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
- - And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!
  - Come on, Lasty!
# Roberto: Hey, Bender.
# [He is pushing a hover-bed. Bender turns around and fakes surprise.]
# Bender: Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?
- - Hey, Bender.
  - Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?
- - Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!
  - Uh, sure. Anything for you, buddy.
- - Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.
  - Uh, what's with the get-up?
- - I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?
  - I'm in! I'm in! So when were you planning the breakout?
# Roberto: I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
# [Bender looks up and sees they are a few hundred yards from the Institute in amongst several trees. A siren goes off and Bender jumps off the bed.]
# Bender: Quick! Let's keep escaping!
- - I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
  - Quick! Let's keep escaping!
# [He snores.]
# [Scene: New New York City Street.]
# Roberto: Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
# Bender: Oh, it was nothing.
# Roberto: [shouting] It was not nothing! [talking] I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
# [He drags Bender into the Big Apple Bank.]
# [Cut to: Big Apple Bank.]
# Roberto: [shouting] Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
# Bender: Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
- - Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
  - Oh, it was nothing.
- - It was not nothing! I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here. ... Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
  - Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
# [The teller ducks and URL and Smitty stand up behind her with their lasers armed.]
# URL: Police! You're busted!
# Smitty: And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof. [Roberto puts his arm through the glass and waves his knife around.] Fire lasers! [They do and the laser bolts bounce off the glass.] Duck! Lasers!
# [Roberto pulls the glass away and with his arm still poking through he grabs the money.]
# Bender: Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
- - Police! You're busted!
  - Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
# [They run out. URL and Smitty fire at them again and Roberto uses the glass as a shield until they are out of the door.]
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. The staff watch Fry sleep on the overturned couch.]

# [Enter Bender and Roberto.]
# Bender: [panting] Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto
# Leela: Wait! Take me first!
# Bender: Yes! Take her first.
- - Wait! Take me first!
  - Yes! Take her first.
- - Wait! Take me first!
  - Yes! Take him first.
- - I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
  - Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
- - 56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--
  - Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!
# [Fry starts to untie them.]
# Leela: You did it, Fry.
# Bender: Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
- - You did it, Fry.
  - Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
# [She kisses him on the cheek.]
# Fry: I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
# Bender: Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot.
# Fry: Aw. Thanks, Bender.
# Bender: Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. [He takes one out and everyone gasps and cringes.] What?
