- - Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress - A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
  - Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?
# Bender: Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. [He chuckles.] Get it? [He chuckles again.] He's coming out--
# Fry: Maybe he has a parasite.
# Hermes: Maybe he is a parasite!
- - Maybe he has a parasite.
  - It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!

  - It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
# Bender: Moron!
# Farnsworth: It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
- - There's only one thing we can do--
  - I'll get the water boiling!
- - Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
  - Moron!
- - You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
  - You're looking less nuts, crabby.
# Bender: Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
- - How do I look?
  - Like whale barf.
- - Look how ridiculous they look.
  - Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
- - Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
  - Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
# Bender: So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
- - Oh, Edna! Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.
  - Oy.
- - Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.
  - Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
# Bender: Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
- - But it's a fight to the death!
  - Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
# Bender: Psst, Fry. Take a dive.
# Bender: Oh, my God!
# Bender: Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
- - Hooray!
  - Yeah!
