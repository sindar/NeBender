conversations:
# [Scene: Fry's and Bender's Lounge. A bad rendition of The Grumpy Snail comes from Fry's room. Bender, wearing pyjama trousers, pokes his head around the corner from his room.]
# Bender: Huh? [He scratches his ass and looks at some signs on Fry's bedroom door. "No Trespassing", "Keep Out", "Private", "Keep Out Bender" and a picture of Bender with a cross through it.] I choose to not understand these signs.
# [Cut to: Fry's Bedroom. The door opens and Bender sees Fry sat on his bed playing the holophonor. The green smoke snakes upwards from it but doesn't form a picture.]
# Bender: Aha!
- - Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
  - Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it.
- - I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
  - Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
- - I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
  - Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.
# [Scene: Outside Holophonor School. The sign reads "Holophonor Teacher. Taking The Joy Out Of Music For 20 Years". Fry and Bender each ride a Segway on the pavement and Fry crashes his into Bender's.]
# Bender: Whoa! Hey!
- - Hello, Philip. And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
  - I prefer the term "love machine".
# [Time Lapse. Everyone sits down and watches the boy with the untidy hair play Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise on his holophonor. The holographic smoke whirls around and forms a picture of an elegantly-dressed man and woman. The man plays an open grand piano and the woman sits on it. Some steps fly around the back of the piano and the woman walks up them. The man follows her and they climb into the clouds. A barrel rolls under them and scores 100 points for each like in the Donkey Kong game. The audience applauds. Bender leans over to the boy's mother.]
# Bender: Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
- - Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child.
  - Then good day, madam! We hope to see you soon for tea.
- - It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
  - Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes. Ahahahahaha.
# [He laughs at Fry's misfortune. Enter Leela with a clipboard.]
# Leela: Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
# Fry: At, uh, uh, a concert.
# Leela: Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
- - Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
  - So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
- - That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
  - Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by devil I mean Robot Devil. And by metaphorically I mean get your coat.
# Robot Devil: You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug! [Doug, the Hellbot with the saxophone, hangs his head in shame.] Let's take it from the top. [Enter Bender and Fry on the slide. They land at the Robot Devil's feet.] Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.
- - Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.
  - No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
# [The Robot Devil cackles.]
# Robot Devil: Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls "stupid fingers". [He twiddles his own fingers then slaps them.] With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle. [Fry looks down and sees his trousers have fallen around his ankles. He quickly pulls them up.] Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?
# Fry: Sure would. [He shrugs.] Oh, well. Goodbye.
# [He turns around and Bender stops him.]
# Bender: Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
- - Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them? Sure would. Oh, well. Goodbye.
  - Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
# Fry: He-He-He is? [He turns around.] Great! Wait, what's the catch?
# Robot Devil: No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours. [Bender rubs his hands with glee.] It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?
# Fry: I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
# Bender: Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
- - I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
  - Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
# [The Robot Devil giggles and drums his fingers on the wheel.]
# Fry: Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
# Robot Devil: Definitely probably not. [A column of rock rises up out of the ground with a piece of paper on top.] Just sign this contract.
- - Definitely probably not. Just sign this contract.
  - Wow!
- - And here we go!
  - I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
# Fry: Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
# Robot Devil: Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.
# Bender: It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
- - Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam! Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.
  - It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
# Scruffy: Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
# Fry: Uh-oh.
# [He quickly puts Bender back together and runs out.]
# Bender: Where'd I go just now?
- - Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator.
  - True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
- - Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
  - Forget it! You can't tempt me.
- - Really? There's nothing you want?
  - Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
- - Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands. To replace these bony hotdogs!
  - Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
- - Well is there anything else you would part with?
  - No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
# [Time Lapse. The Robot Devil screws a large, white airhorn into Bender's nose slot.]
# Bender: Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
- - You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender. Now find someone and give'em a good blast!
  - Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
# [Cut to: Planet Express Corridor. Leela walks through the door into the corridor between the lounge and meeting room and walks straight into Bender who blasts her with his airhorn. She holds her ears to block out the noise. Bender stops and laughs. The Robot Devil peeks around the corner from the meeting room.]
# Bender: Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
- - What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!
  - Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
- - Ah, how delightfully ironic.
  - It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
- - Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
  - Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal-- Oh, nooo!
- - Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.
  - OK, deaf-o!
# Holo-Bender: [singing] Leela! Leela, Leela save him!
# Save Fry, save Fry,
# Godzilla will devour him,
# As for me,
# I must be off,
# To have my doctor check this cough,
# [He coughs.]
# Goodbye!
# [He turns away but Godzilla slams its foot down and blocks his path. Bender watches.]
# Bender: I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done.
- - Leela! Leela, Leela save him! Save Fry, save Fry, Godzilla will devour him, As for me, I must be off, To have my doctor check this cough, Goodbye!
  - I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done.
# [In the audience, Bender reads from a dictionary.]
# Bender: [singing] The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,
# Now that is "irony".
