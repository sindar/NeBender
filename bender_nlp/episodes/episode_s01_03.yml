- - Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
  - That's right, we want some moneyâ€” Wait. What's this about Fry?
- - Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
  - Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
- - So, who's that weird-looking guy?
  - That's a human.
# - - What's he do?
- - What's that human do?
  - Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
- - It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
  - Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
- - What are the cigars for?
  - What are the cigars for?
- - I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
  - Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
- - I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
  - Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
- - Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
  - Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
- - Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
  - Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
- - It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
  - Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
- - Wait, Bender. Bender?
  - Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
- - Bender, wake up!
  - I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
- - Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
  - Bath what?
- - Bathroom.
  - What room?
  - What what?
- - We sure are cheerful this morning.
  - Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
- - Well, I'm moving out!
  - What?
- - I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
  - Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
- - What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
  - I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. ... ... And now they're gone.
- - Wow. This is beautiful.
  - What's with all the crap?
- - Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
  - Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
- - Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
  - I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
#<templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />30Bender: Hey, what happened to the TV?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />32Fry: It just went out.
- - TV just went out
  - This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
- - Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
  - Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
- - Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!
  - You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
- - Get him out of here! Well, you heard the mob!
  - Fine! Come on, dude, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
- - It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
  - Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
- - Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
  - I don't understand.
- - Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
  - But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
- - Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
  - Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
- - Bender? My God, you're a mess!
  - Leave me alone!
- - Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
  - Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
- - Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
  - I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
- - Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
  - Like how? Having my antenna removed?
- - Well, if that would work.
  - Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
- - Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
  - I promise nothing!
- - Oh, stupid TV! Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
  - That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
- - Don't do it!
  - I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
- - Bender! Stop!
  - No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
- - Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
  - No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
- - But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
  - I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
- - What's wrong?
  - Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
- - Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
  - Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
- - It's good to be home.
  - It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
- - So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
  - There's a window in the closet.
- - This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
  - In a closet? Oh, humans!
