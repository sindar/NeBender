- - Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?
  - No.
# Fry: Let's see what tools we'll need. [Hammer.] Uh-huh. [Screwdriver.] Uh-huh. [Bending unit.] Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set.
# [Bender takes a board out of the box and puts it down.]
# Bender: Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.

# [Time Lapse. Fry and Leela tighten the last nut with Bender.]
# Bender: Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!
# [Enter Bender.]
# Bender: Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.
# Leela: It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.
# Fry: Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
# Bender: Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed. [He starts walking back up the steps.] See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever. [He opens his chest cabinet.] I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away.

# Leela: We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
# Fry: Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.

  - So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this. Also I got this going.
# Fry: Captain Yesterday!
# [Leela bursts through.]
# Leela: Clobberella!
- - Captain Yesterday! Clobberella!
  - And Superking! The best one of the three!
# [Superking lands in front of them.]
# Bender: Ta-da!
# Leela: Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
# Bender: Superking has no need for loved ones. [Tinny Tim holds out a pad for Superking's autograph. Bender signs it and kicks his crutch away. He falls down in a crumpled heap.] How ya doin', kid?
# [They start to leave.]
# Poopenmeyer: Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect. [He turns around and presses the button again. Bender wobbles again.] Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers?
# Leela: Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!
# [She leaves.]
# Bender: Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
# [He leaves.]
# Fry: And I can't take life anymore.
- - Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect. Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers? Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!
  - Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
# Poopenmeyer: His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets -- to kill! And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a.k.a. Citizen Snips.
# Leela: You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!
# [She and Fry run out with Bender gasping and puffing behind them.]
# Bender: [gasping] Hold the elevator!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Bathroom. Leela addresses an envelope to her parents and puts the surface passes in and flushes it down the toilet.]
# Bender: We're in here too.
# Fry: Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.
# Leela: Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
# Bender: 9, 10 a big fat hen. [He takes a puff of his cigar.] The name's Bender!

# [An elephant picks the tour guide up and eats her. In a scene lifted from Batman the New Justice Team spring into action. A yak charges towards Fry and he punches it. "YAK!!!" comes across the screen. Bender picks a fight with a boxing kangaroo.]
# Bender: You're going down, my friend! Down Under!
# Leela: No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!
# [She runs down the stairs while the Zookeeper runs off in another direction. Bender holds out his arms at the bottom of the staircase.]
# Bender: I got it, I got it! [He screams.] I don't got it!
- - Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper.
  - You can get off me anytime.
# [The Zookeeper gives it a cracker.]
# Fry: Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
# Leela: Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.
# [Bender puts on his crown.]
# Bender: We are not amused.
# Leela: We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
# Fry: But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?
- - We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald! But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?
  - Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!
- - El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
  - El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?
# [Scene: Cave.]
# Fry: So this is your lair?
# Zookeeper: Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!
# Fry: OK, take it easy!
# Bender: Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
# Bender: Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
# Fry: I guess, as long as you think it's right.
# Bender: Superheroes away!
