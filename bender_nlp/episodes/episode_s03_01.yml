conversations:
- - Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
  - Alright, yup.
# Leela: Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
# [He keels over and rests on Fry's shoulder. Fry looks at him.]
# Fry: He's dead.
# [Everyone gasps.]
# Bender: What?
- - Look what arrived - My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already! Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.
- - We gotta go rescue them!
  - Eh, I don't know.
- - Bender! Think of the señoritas!
  - Vamonos! #Vámonos!
- - Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?
  - No. But what do you make of this?
- - I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
  - Oh, your God!
- - Alright, here's the plan--
  - What kind of moronic plan is that? #Wow!
# Leela: Where are all the men in your society?
- - Men die out many year ago.
  - With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?
- - Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness.
  - Translation - Boring! # [He, Zapp and Fry burst into laughter.] [laughing] That's a good one! [He literally gets his head bashed in.] Ow!
- - The men must die.
  - Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks.
- - He big jerk like man.
  - I sure am. But check the crotch. Nothing.
- - Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers.
  - I'll miss you, meatbag.
- - We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.
  - Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! ... Alright, I'll go! # Bender: Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! [Amy grabs his arm and curses in Chinese.] Alright, I'll go!
- - Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
  - Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
# - - Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out! 
- - Cease hitting Femputer!
  - You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
- - It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
  - But why?
- - Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
  - What?
- - Come back later. Leave me alone.
  - Yeah, get lost! Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners! And bring gold. Lots of gold.
- - You heard the man.
  - C'mon! Gimme some of that!
- - It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
  - Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!
