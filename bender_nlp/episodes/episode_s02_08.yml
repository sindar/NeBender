- - Good morning, people.
  - My man!
- - Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
  - Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits - The Movie.
- - Yeah, I wanna see that.
  - Good point, Bender.
# Bender: Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
- - And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting.
  - Go, Masked Unit! Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! You mind taking your head off?
- - I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie.
  - Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
- - Sir, she is as the factory made her.
  - Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
- - Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat.
  - Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh...
- - Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?
  - Sure thing, pal.
- - Uh, sir?
  - Who threw that?
- - That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!
  - Oh, I'm boned.
- - Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen.
  - You should see me at funerals.
- - Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
  - Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
# Bender: I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!
- - Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
  - It is?
- - There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
  - Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- - Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.
  - Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
- - I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
  - Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
- - Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
  - Still ... can't ... reach!
# Bender: Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
# Bender: You can't hit what you can't see!
# Bender: Huh?
- - Nice work out there, kid.
  - Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
- - Hi, boss. Yo, dude!
  - Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
- - What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged. It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins.
  - You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
- - Bingo!
  - Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
- - In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator.
  - Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
- - Presenting Bender the Offender!
  - I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
# Bender: You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
- - Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
  - What do you mean, "we"?
- - I said "us".
  - Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!
- - What about us, Mr. The Offender?
  - Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
# Bender: Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?
- - Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
  - What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
# Doubledeal: Bender, your popularity is slipping.
- - Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
  - Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
- - Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
  - But the crowd loves me.
- - Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona - The Gender Bender.
  - Oh, yeah? Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
- - You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
  - Oh, yeah? Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
# - - I am Destructor!
#   - See you at the fight. # [squeaky]
# Bender: So then I said, "See you at the fight." And that's the story.
- - Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
  - It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
- - You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
  - I'm a real toughie!
- - Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!
  - I'll put on my tutu!
- - According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
  - Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
- - Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
  - Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
- - Keep laughing, Fnog! Ready, Bender?
  - I was born ready! Gimme the bell! Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain. Now boarding standby passengers--
# Bender: [weakly] Fry! Throw in the towel! [He doesn't.] For God's sakes, Fry!
# Bender: [weakly] Mommy!
# Leela: OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog? [There is nothing but an antenna in Fnog's corner.] Hmm.
# [Destructor stamps on Bender.]
# Bender: Why won't anyone help me?
# Bender: Huh? It's bendering time! [He throws some fake punches.] Take this. And this!
# Bender: I think you misunderstood the concept of "bendering time"!
- - Yes!
  - Yes! Oh!
- - I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
  - I'm in tremendous pain here.
- - Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
  - Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
