- - Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
  - Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
- - Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
  - New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
- - Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
  - Mmm, tasty!
- - Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
  - I'm boned.
- - Freeze, scuzzbot!
  - Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. ... I'm sure there's-- ...I say I'm sure there's-- ... That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
- - I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
  - Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
- - I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
  - Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are. ... Huh? Huh?

# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />34Leela: I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. [She stamps the floorboards.] The floors are made of such hard wood.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />39Bender: Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />43Fry: What's wrong with it?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />44Bender: Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
- - I have an idea for a sitcom.
  - Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
- - You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
  - Yeah, it is cute.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />52Fry: I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />54Leela: But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />58Bender: Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
- - I'm rich! I can live whenever I want. But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
  - Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
- - Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
  - I'm a thing.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />01Fry: Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />08Leela: Since when do you care about us?
# <templatestyles src="Mono/styles.css" />10Bender: We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
- - Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here. Since when do you care about us?
  - We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
- - Goodbye-ee!
  - Whee!
- - I was robbed. They got everything except these.
  - Who did?
