# Bender: Behold: The Internet!
- - Hey, that's me!
  - No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
# Bender: I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
# Bender: [sexfully] Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
- - Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
  - So how 'bout them Knicks?
- - Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
  - Is the Space Pope reptilian?
- - After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.
  - Too bad it's a dump.
# Alcazar: This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
# Leela: Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
# Bender: Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
# Bender: Ow! Ow! Ow!
- - OK, OK, I'll do the dishes. Hey, where'd they go?
  - Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel - Worshipping some low-life jerk.
# Leela: [shaking hands] Glad you could make it.
# Bender: [shaking hands] It's a magical day.
- - Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
  - Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
- - But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
  - I don't know, Buddy. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough. # buddy = Fry
- - Bender, snap out of it!
  - Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go. I love stealing, I love taking things!
# Fry: Come on, boy, jump! [The lizards crash through the gate.] Good boy!
# [Cut to: Forbidden Valley. Fry and Bender come to a clifftop.]
# Bender: Whoa, Mittens!
- - My God! Four identical castles!
  - Each more identical than the last!
- - That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
  - And here's another one with no eyes.
# Alcazar: Well, this is the real me. But I can explain: We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
# [Bender cries.]
# Bender: [crying] He's a saint!
