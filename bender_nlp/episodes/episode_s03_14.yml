conversations:
- - Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
  - Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
# Leela: No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
# [Fry turns around and sees his jets turning Bender red-hot.]
# Bender: [shouting] Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
- - No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
  - Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
# [He wipes his mouth on his sleeve.]
# Bender: Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
# Tate: What's that funky jazz?
# Farnsworth: The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
# Bender: Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
- - The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
  - Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
- - Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us  ... they cause these dents, or "time skips".
  - You are so smart!
- - We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.
  - Alright!
# Tate: Jamming!
# Fry: Hooray for Leela!
# Bender: And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
- - Jamming! Hooray for Leela!
  - And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
- - Fry, please try to understand - You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
  - Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes
# Fry: How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
# Hermes: Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.
# Amy: Um, no.
# Fry: I don't know what I'm doing.
# Bender: Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?
# Tate: Hell, no.
- - How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
  - Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?
# [Scene: Planet Express: Attic Room. Farnsworth and Tate look over Tate's equations.]
# Farnsworth: No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.
# Tate: Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes.
# [Bender laughs.]
# Bender: Vintage Bubblegum!
- - Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes.
  - Vintage Bubblegum!
# Tate: Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
# Amy: Hooray!
# Hermes: Yes!
# Zoidberg: I'm a Globetrotter!
# [Bender runs in.]
# Bender: [gasping] Did you just say--
# Tate: Too late, hot plate.
# Bender: Oh, crap.
- - Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
  - Did you just say--
- - Too late, hot plate.
  - Oh, crap.
# [Scene: Planet Express: Hangar. Two Globetrotters attach a doomsday device to a mechanism and it rises into the cargo bay. The other Globetrotters shake hands with the Planet Express staff.]
# Tate: We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
# [They leave, dribbling their balls. Bender stops Tate.]
# Bender: Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
- - We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
  - Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
# [He stretches his legs.]
# Tate: Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?
# Bender: Yes.
# Tate: Are you?
# Bender: I mean, with time, my funk level could--
# Tate: Are you?
# Bender: [sadly] No.
# Tate: Deal with it.
- - Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself - Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?
  - Yes.
- - Are you?
  - I mean, with time, my funk level could--
- - Are you?
  - No.
# [He leaves and Bender returns to his normal size and begins to cry.]
# [Scene: The ship flies towards the nebula and Bender emerges from the starboard torpedo tube holding the doomsday device. He is tethered to the ship and wearing a jet pack. The tether jerks and Bender lets go of the doomsday device.]
# Bender: Oh! No!
- - Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
  - What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
# [She takes his hand, kisses him on the cheek and walks away. Bender walks in, dusting his hands.]
# Bender: Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
- - She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
  - Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
# Fry: [screaming] No! [The doomsday device implodes and the nebula, the stars and Fry's message disappear. Fry stares at the empty void. Leela and Bender walk in.] Did you see it? Did you see it?
# Bender: The explosion?
- - No! Did you see it? Did you see it?
  - The explosion?
