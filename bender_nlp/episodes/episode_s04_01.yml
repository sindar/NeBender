# Kif: [on screen] Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them.
# Amy: [shouting] Bender!
- - Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them. Bender!
  - Not my fault if you don't check me! [He pushes his flashing antenna down and a tape inside him rewinds.] Messages erased.
- - This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
  - I don't even breathe oxygen!
# Zapp: Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!
# [He shoots at them. They dodge the lasers and one shot hits the wall. The bridge starts decompressing. The holograms are blown out into space through the hole. Leela grabs hold of Zapp's chair, Fry grabs her legs and Bender grabs Fry's legs. His chest cabinet opens and an Egyptian artefact falls out. He groans. Zapp flies by and grabs Bender's legs.]
# Bender: Hey!
# [He reaches for Bender but he doesn't help.]
# Kif: Please hold me!
# Bender: Have a good one! [He flies towards the hole. The holographic Moon bounces in, bounces across the bridge and plugs the hole. The wind stops and everyone hits the floor.] Oh, man!
- - Please hold me!
  - Have a good one! ... Oh, man!
# Kif: Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
# Amy: Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
# Leela: And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
# Bender: Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! [He goes for Kif and everyone restrains him.] Come over here, Kif! You--
- - Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant! Yes it's ... great. A great miracle. And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
  - Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! Come over here, Kif! You--
- - At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voila.
  - Well, OK. But that better be all there is!
- - Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
  - A test! I demand a test!
# [Scene: Planet Express: Hangar. A large centrifuge is in the middle of the room. Fry, Leela, Zapp and Amy stand around it. Kif, Farnsworth and Bender stand on the catwalk above.]
# Farnsworth: Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber. [Fry, Leela, Amy and Zapp walk into it.] Now to take a DNA sample. [He draws some liquid from Kif, making him deflate, then puts the liquid in a part of the machine.] When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!
# [He pulls the switch and the maternifuge starts spinning. Everyone in it screams. Farnsworth drops the floor from underneath them.]
# Bender: Faster! Faster!
- - When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!
  - Faster! Faster!
# [Scene: Fry's and Bender's Lounge. The Planet Express staff, Kif, Zapp and Leo and Inez Wong are gathered for baby shower. Bender wears his chef hat and hands out hors d'Oeuvres.]
# Bender: Zoidberg?
- - So let's open the gifts.
  - Alright!
- - I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender.
  - It's my booties from when I was a kid.
- - Uh, they're already bronzed.
  - They are bronze.
- - Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--
  - Mine!
# [He dries his tears with a mouth flap.]
# Amy: [crying] Yes, it's, it's-- [She shakes her head.] No! I can't do this!
# [She runs out of the room, crying. Everyone gasps.]
# Bender: Oh, my God!
- - Yes, it's, it's-- No! I can't do this!
  - Oh, my God!
# [Bender sees a large blue creature.]
# Bender: Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
# [He laughs. The creature's tongue wraps around him and it tries to swallow him.]
# Kif: It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
# [He inflates his head. The froad screams and drops Bender.]
# Bender: I'm back, baby!
# Kif: I'll try to endure.
# Grand Midwife: Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.
# [Kif looks at Bender.]
# Bender: What are you looking at?
- - Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?
  - Both.
# [Kif's bump rumbles.]
# Kif: Oh, no time! It has begun! [He and Amy gulp back some of the tea and Kif falls back into the Midwife's arms. Amy holds his head and he groans.] Oh, my!
# [Everyone else cringes at what is happening. Bender pulls out a camera and takes a photo.]
# Bender: Neat!
# [Kif pushes again.]
# Kif: Whoa, Nellie!
# [He pushes some more and eventually some spawn comes from between his legs and makes a splash. Leela, Fry and Zapp cover their noses.]
# Bender: Oh, man!
- - The birthing is complete!
  - Alright!
# Kif: Oh, thank goodness!
# Grand Midwife: I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
# Fry: Congratulations!
# Zapp: Nice work!
# Bender: Way to go, squishy!
- - I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
  - Way to go, squishy!
