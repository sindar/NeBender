- - Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.
  - And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
- - Well that's only for people in the military.
  - What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
- - Alright, look. Our policy is - If for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you.
  - OK, now I'm mad!
# Bender: Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!
- - Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?
  - You know, playing you all for chumps?
- - Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
  - Great, we're gonna die.
- - A valid question. We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this -  They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.
  - They look like dorks!
- - Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
  - You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
- - Aww, she sounds sweet.
  - But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--
- - Give this to my son.
  - You got it!
- - Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
  - Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
- - Bender! No!
  - If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
- - Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp.
  - I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
- - Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me, so I'm sending you on one last mission.
  - Hot diggidy daffodil!
- - A mission of peace.
  - Oh!
- - Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger.
  - Is he any good?
# Bender: Whoa! Scuse me.
- - We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type.
  - My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.
- - The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
  - These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?
- - We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
  - Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. Bite my shiny metal--
- - Stop! You can't say the next word.
  - Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
- - Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
  - Bender's got the upper hand now. The name of the game is "Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet". I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
- - Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle.
  - That's it, I'm saying it! "A" is for--
# Fry: Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?
# Brain Ball #2: Correct.
# Bender: Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
- - Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens? Correct.
  - Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson - Don't mess with Earth.
- - May you bounce in peace.
  - Get the hell off my planet.
# Farnsworth: Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. [shouting] Wake up!
# [He slaps Bender. Bender yawns and sits up.]
# Bender: Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?
- - I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it. It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know.
  - Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say "ass"? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
- - We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it. It's from the list of words you almost never say.
  - That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
- - We think it's better if you don't know.
  - Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it "please"?
- - No.
  - Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! "Thanks"!
- - Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
  - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it "sorry"? No. "Fun-derful"? Uh, "non-alcoholic"?
- - Stop it, mon! Enough already!
  - Compassion? Shrimptoast? Antiquing? I'm alright!
