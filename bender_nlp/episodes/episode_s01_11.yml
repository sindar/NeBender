# Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. [He presses a button on the trolley and it lowers itself to the floor.] We've got a very special delivery today.
# Fry: Who's it going to?
# Farnsworth: Me.
# [Bender dusts off his hands.]
# Bender: Another job well done.
# Bender: [pointing] Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.
# [He points to a beaten up frat house with a neon "ERR" sign atop it. There is a smashed-up car, some kegs, a cable spool being used as a table, some kegs, some dustbins, some kegs, some upturned chairs and some kegs around it.]
- - You went to college?
  - Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
- - What was your minor?
  - Robo-American Studies.
- - Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
  - Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
- - Eh, close enough. C'mon in.
  - Thanks. Here's your finger back.
# Bender: All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
# Fratbot #2: Mate in 143 moves.
# Fratbot #3: Oh, pooh. You win again!
# Bender: Uh-oh, nerds!
# Oily: Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
# Fat-bot: I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
# Bender: [modest] Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
- - Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot.
  - You're all losers. My name's Bender.
- - Wow, you're a legend around here!
  - Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
- - I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
  - Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
- - No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
  - Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
- - This is gonna be great!
  - Bingo!
- - Oh, mama!
  - Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!
# Meiderneyer: I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
# Chet: This time Robot House has gone too far.
- - I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
  - Cheese it!
- - This time Robot House has gone too far.
  - Cheese it!
# Woman: [on phone] Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
# [Vernon takes off his glasses.]
# Vernon: Robot House!
# [Enter Bender and the other fratbots.]
- - Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
  - Hey, dean, nice looking model.
- - Robot House!
  - Hey, dean, nice looking model.
- - You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
  - Now, I can explain that.
- - That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!
  - No fair!
# Vernon: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years: My model ship.
# [He looks down. The ship isn't on his desk. His jaw drops when he sees Fat-bot eating it.]
# Gearshift: Fat-bot! No!
# Fat-bot: When I get nervous I get hungry.
# [Vernon grits his teeth.]
# Bender: Cheese it!
# Fry: Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?
# [Guenter's parents swing around on the chandelier. He groans and runs out.]
# Bender: Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.
- - I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
  - Oh, yeah? Watch this!
# Vernon: Fraternities, on your marks.
# [He fires the starting gun at the fratbots' boat and it starts to deflate. The SS Von Snoot sails off.]
# Bender: Hey!
- - Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
  - Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
# Bender: [shouting] Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
