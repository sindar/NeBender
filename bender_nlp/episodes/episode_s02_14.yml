# Bender: Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.
- - Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
  - I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. I love her that much.
- - What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
  - Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea. And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old. But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.
- - So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
  - I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
# Bender: Come on, you call yourselves chumps?
- - Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
  - Uh, wasn't me!
- - I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
  - Upsy-daisy.
# Tinny Tim: Oh. [The Crushinator runs him over.] Oh!
# Bender: [pointing] Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?
# Leela: Um, alright.
# Fry: Not really.
# Bender: Well, if you insist. But you're paying!
# Bender: Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!
# Leela: They're so lifeless-like.
# Bender: [pointing] That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.
- - See through the eyes of a bender unit. Fine.
  - Hey, let me try. Whoa! That gives me a headache.
- - Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.
  - Who is he? I'll kill him!
- - Who's my favourite robot?
  - It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
- - Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children.
  - I'm her favourite.
- - Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her.
  - Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
# Mom: Hello, dearies.
# Bender: Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!
- - Let the bloodbath begin!
  - That's my mama!
# Bender: Hello, losers!
- - Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
  - No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?
- - The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
  - From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.
- - Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!
  - Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
- - No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires.
  - Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
# Bender: Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?
- - You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me.
  - Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
- - No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie.
  - Say what?
- - In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels.
  - No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
- - Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
  - OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!
# Bender: Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
