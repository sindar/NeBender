conversations:
- - Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
  - So we're in international waters?
# Farnsworth: Indeed so.
# Bender: Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. [A speedboat pulls up next to the ship and a man hands Bender a package which he puts in his chest cabinet. The speedboat pulls away and Bender turns to Fry and Farnsworth who haven't noticed anything.] Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
- - The sun, the sea air, good friends.
  - Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
# Hermes: Why not?
# Amy: Yeah.
# Farnsworth: Yeah, cool.
# Bender: Everybody kick in five bucks. [Everyone except Zoidberg hands him $5.] There, wasn't that interesting?
- - Why not? Yeah, cool.
  - Everybody kick in five bucks. There, wasn't that interesting?
- - This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
  - Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
- - I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
  - Harpoon, my ass!
# Bender: Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
- - Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
  - Fine. I'll head over to the other side. Good luck fishing on this side!
- - I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
  - Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
- - Aha! Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
  - Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
- - Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
  - Quit exaggerating, buddy. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. here. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending. # buddy = Fry
- - Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
  - Then why do I have to be careful?
- - Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
  - I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. What? I put sunblock on you.
- - Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
  - Hey, I'm snagged.
# Bender: What's that? Is someone bending girders?
# Leela: You did it, Fry!
# Fry: Did what?
# [The ship hits some rocks and everyone is thrown across the room, screaming. The ship comes to a rest on the ocean floor. Bender looks out the window.]
# Bender: People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.
- - There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
  - Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
# Zoidberg: How are you doing there, Fry? [Fry blubbers.] Glad to hear it. [He picks up another fish.] Aha!
# [He puts it in Bender's chest cabinet. Bender sees an electric eel and grabs it. It shocks him.]
# Bender: Aw, yeah!
# Zoidberg: Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
# [Bender emerges from the boat wearing a pirate hat and an eye patch and carrying some grog bottles.]
# Bender: Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog. [He opens the bottle and tries to drink what is in it but the liquid just drips out and trails away from him in the ocean current.] Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!
- - Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
  - Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
- - I think I saw a mermaid.
  - You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
- - No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
  - Yeah, right!
- - Where's Fry?
  - I didn't kill him. Professor?
- - We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
  - I got it covered. In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.
# Zoidberg: I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
# [The staff follow him across the seabed. They peek over a mound and gasp. Ahead of them is a city.]
# Bender: [awestruck] Bend me!
# Bender: Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! [whispering] I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
# Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
# Fry: Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
# [Bender hugs Fry.]
# Bender: [crying] Oh, Fry! [He bawls.] I'll miss you!
- - No! My home! It burned down! How did this happen?
  - So that's where I left my cigar.
- - And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000.
  - Hey, buddy!
# Bender: Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
