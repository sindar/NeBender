conversations:
- - Hey, Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode.
  - Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 'cause of what I did in the coffee pot.
- - Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?
  - Shut up and get to the point!
- - Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
  - C'mon, buddy, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines. # buddy = Fry
- - But, Bender, you are--
  - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
# Fry: Hey, Leela, get a picture of me being "mugged".
# [He dangles his wallet in front of the mugger and Leela takes a photo.]
# Mugger: I'll take the camera too.
# [He takes it and runs out through an exit. Fry laughs until he realises what has happened. He clears his throat.]
# Bender: Learning is fun.
- - Yeah, I asked a cop once. It means "Up yours, kid".
  - I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people. Hey, a suicide booth! So long, suckers.
- - Uh, sorry, Bender, that's just a phone booth.
  - Oh. #[disappointed]
- - I'll show you. Whup.
  - Oh, it's a turnstile.
# Leela: What's this? [She sniffs.] Another bathroom?
# Fry: No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent.
# [He lies down on a seat and puts a newspaper over him. Bender hits him.]
# Bender: C'mon, Fry. Get up!
- - Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader, Al Sharpton.
  - Ooh. Now this guy had taste!
- - Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga...
  - We've come a long way, baby!
- - Nope. No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. Nice! Listen to that baby purr.
  - There's a baby in there, huh?
# Bender: I think I got whiplash.
- - You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck.
  - I meant ass whiplash.
- - No duh, dreadlock, we're both bending units.
  - Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?
- - "3370318"
  - No way! Mine's 2716057!
- - I don't get it.
  - We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes.
- - I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
  - Shut up and hoot. ... Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe.
- - Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan.
  - Pervert.
- - It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000.
  - How much more?
# Bender: Halt. Who goes there?
- - Don't point that at me.
  - Dude who? # dude = Fry
- - Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.
  - My God, Pal! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal An ugly little word called "prejudice". # pal = Fry
- - I'm not prejudiced.
  - Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!
- - Keeping an eye on the safe?
  - You know it!
- - Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while.
  - Alright.
- - Then it wasn't space bandidos. Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape.
  - Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender.
- - Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
  - I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.
- - OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.
  - Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.
# Bender: Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room.
- - Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
  - And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
- - Give it up!
  - Alright, take it. Sheesh!
- - Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
  - It's a darn shame.
- - Or maybe, he never left at all! Wait a minute. You're Bender.
  - Of course, who said I wasn't?
- - But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
  - It's a little thing called "style". Look it up sometime.
- - So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?
  - 200,001?
- - 200,000?
  - 200,001?
# Barker: Next up in what is generously called the "Talent Competition", performing a traditional gangsta rap, Miss-- What the--
# [Flexo runs onto the stage followed by Bender, Fry and Leela. The women scream and Bender dives on Flexo.]
# Bender: Gotcha!
- - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
  - Shoot him, he's choking me!
- - Alright, enough of this. There's the atom!
  - Aw, jeez.
- - Bender? You stole the atom?
  - Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable.
- - I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
  - Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.
- - I almost had that tiara.
  - Me too.
