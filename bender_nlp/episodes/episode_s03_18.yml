conversations:
- - Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
  - Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
- - Are you ready, Bender?
  - I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
# [Farnsworth throws a switch and Bender is zapped with electricity Ã  la the countless Frankenstein films. He slowly starts to take human form. He grows hair, a nose and...]
# Hermes: Cover your shame, mon!
# [He puts some underpants on Bender. The table tips up and human Bender walks off. Everyone gasps.]
# Farnsworth: It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!
# [Amy cries. Bender looks at his new self.]
# Bender: So this is a human body, huh? Neat! [He feels the top of his head.] Hey, my antenna's gone. [He looks at his crotch.] No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
# - - Cover your shame, mon! It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!
#   - So this is a human body, huh? Neat! ... Hey, my antenna's gone. No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
# Fry: [whispering] Bender, no! You'll make God cry.
# Bender: Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do. [He spits and Hermes leans out the way of it.] Hey, that's pretty fun. [He vomits and laughs.] Being human is great!
# - - Bender, no! You'll make God cry.
#   - Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do. Hey, that's pretty fun. ... Being human is great!
# [He vomits again. Zoidberg cheers.]
# Zoidberg: Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
# [What-If Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender walks out of the bathroom.]
# Bender: Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
# Leela: Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off.
# [Bender looks Amy up and down.]
# Bender: Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
# Amy: [sexfully] You're not so bad yourself, big boy.
# [She kisses him.]
# Bender: Hey, that felt great! [He kisses Farnsworth.] Nah, it's not working anymore.
# - - Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
#   - But now it's bad for me!
# - - Speaking of which, try these nachos.
#   - Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
# - - Bender, part of being human is having self control.
#   - Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
# [He picks up the box of nachos and the others restrain him.]
# Amy: No, Bender!
# Hermes: No!
# Leela: Stop him.
# Bender: Let me go.
# Leela: No!
# Farnsworth: Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?
# [Bender climbs out of a window.]
# [Cut to: Outside O'Zorgnax's Pub. Bender runs down the street.]
# Bender: [shouting] Goodbye, moderation!
# [Farnsworth continues.]
# Farnsworth: This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes.
# [Bender groans and looks at a woman.]
# Bender: C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. [The woman cringes.] Hey, you like grilled cheese?
# Wernstrom: Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science.
# [The scientists cheer and applaud.]
# Bender: Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
# [The scientists look at each other.]
# Wernstrom: Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore--
# Bender: [shouting] Party!
# [Cut to: Outside Planet Express. The ships follow his orders.]
# [Cut to: Fry's Ship. Fry gulps down some Shasta.]
# Fry: I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields.
# [Everyone gasps.]
# Bender: He's a madman! A madman!
# Farnsworth: Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
# Amy: Yeah!
# Bender: Right on!
- - Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
  - Right on!
- - OK. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.
  - Boo-hoo.
# [She hits him on the back of the head and his eyes fly out and hit Fry.]
# Fry: Ow!
# [Bender looks around for his eyes.]
# Bender: Uh ... where?
# Leela: Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
# Fry: Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
# Bender: Beer! Beer!
# Leela: Whiskey OK?
# [She pours some into his mouth and he belches fire, igniting Fry's arm. Fry pats out the flames.]
# Bender: Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
- - Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
  - Hooray!
# Zoidberg: Alright!
# Fry: That's great, Leela.
# Bender: I've heard worse excuses to drink. [He opens the bottle and it sprays over Mom.] Oops!
# [Purple smoke emanates from Mom.]
# Mom: I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
# [She melts until there is nothing left of her but a puddle.]
# Bender: Well, no point letting her go to waste.
# Farnsworth: And you, lad, all you need is brain.
# Fry: Why does everyone keep saying that?
# [Bender takes Zoidberg's gun.]
# Bender: This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!
- - Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks.
  - Oh, crap.
# [He stands on the stairs, pulling up his scrubs. Leela moans as she melts.]
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Bender throws a bucket of water on her.]
# Bender: Wake up!
