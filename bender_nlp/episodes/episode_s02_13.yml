# Bender: Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one.
# Announcer: [on loudspeaker] And now, here he is: Chef, restaurateur, author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar!
# [The audience applauds and Bender leaps up cheering.]
# Bender: Yeah! [Above them Elzar flies in on a jet pack and lands at the back of the studio.] Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!
# Bender: Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you. [He holds up a crude picture of himself staring lovey-eyed at Elzar. Elzar takes it stamps "I'll Sign This For $50.00. x___" on it and hands it back to Bender.] [crying] Oh, Elzar! Bless you!
# Bender: [disappointed] Oh. [The audience claps and cheers.] [normal] Alright, yeah! [The "Applause" sign changes to "Less Applause".] [quietly] Alright, yeah!
- - Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
  - Oh. Alright, yeah! Alright, yeah!
- - Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo.
  - Boiled? Interesting.
- - Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
  - No, you shut up.
- - Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel. Bam!
  - Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!
- - Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
  - Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us.
- - If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch.
  - I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film. Hey, Elzar, think fast.
- - Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
  - Bam!
# Bender: It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!
- - Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget.
  - Hooray for blind-y!
# Bender: Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!
- - No, thanks. That's robot food.
  - It's so good. Oh, just try a little!
- - Everybody enjoy their dinner?
  - God, yes, Elzar.
- - The old dine-and-dash, huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
  - Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
- - Listen to the smart robot.
  - I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?
- - No question.
  - So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
- - OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.
  - Hot diggety!
- - You'd better keep your nose clean.
  - That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
# Bender: Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.
- - Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you. Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...
  - Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call.
# [Scene: Elzar's Fine Cuisine Foyer. Elzar empties the cash from the till into his pockets. Bender walks in covered in grease and wearing an apron.]
# Bender: I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. [He takes a mint from a bowl and leaves grease over the rest of them.] So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
- - Bam!
  - Bam yourself! Hey, who are they?
- - Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
  - Are they the Robot Mafia?
# Waitress: But that table's already--
# [Enter Bender.]
# Bender: Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen. [He walks over to the table and pulls the tablecloth away, leaving the plates and glasses undisturbed. The family applauds.] No, what I meant to do was--
# [He slides the plates off the table and they fall to the floor and break.]
# Woman: Oh!
# Man: I can't believe this!
# Bender: Mind your own business and get out!
- - Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
  - No, you gave me a fifty.
- - Oh, no I didn't.
  - Yeah, you did.
- - Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
  - I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
- - Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble. It's money.
  - Wow! Thanks.
- - Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
  - You gave me a twenty.
- - I did? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute. I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?
  - Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! Hey, Elzar! I quit!
- - We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run.
  - Wow, you guys run numbers?
- - Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy "The Mechanical Bull" Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
  - That's just what my mom used to tell me.
# Bender: That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in.
- - You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
  - Aw, crap! The cops!
- - Gotcha!
  - What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?
- - Nice job, Bender. You passed the test. You wanna join me, Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad at our, uh, social club tomorrow night?
  - Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies.
# Bender: Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
- - Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle.
  - A little of this, huh?
- - Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxen-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps.
  - How 'bout "Blotto"? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.
- - What d'you think, Blotto? You in?
  - It's funny - Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
- - Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi.
  - An alibi, huh?
# Bender: [groaning; from quarters] I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
- - But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
  - I can't move.
# Bender: [groaning; on tape] Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
# Bender: You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?
- - We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
  - Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
- - Alright, here's the battle plan - We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping, then we heist the cigars and go home.
  - And all without killing anyone. This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that.
- - Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting.
  - Um, uh, um. ... Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!
- - Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
  - Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
- - Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
  - Capital idea, old sport. #... I say, get the hell off me!
- - That guy sounds familiar.
  - My word, what have we-- Uh, nothing to see here, old girl.
- - I got a little surprise in store for that guy - The clamps! Eh?
  - Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.
- - Oh, no! Poor Bender.
  - Oh, I don't feel good.
# Bender: [from quarters] Chew on this! [normal voice] Ooh, ah! [fake voice] What ho! [normal voice] Stop it!
# [Cut to: Fry's and Bender's Quarters. Bender sits reading Somewhat Fantastic Sci-Fi. He hits himself on the head with a frying pan.]
# Bender: [fake voice] Take that, you twit. [normal voice] No! Stop it!
- - That's the last of 'em. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
  - Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.
# Donbot: Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?
# [He pats Bender's cheek and leaves.]
# Clamps: [muttering] He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ... [He and Joey leave.] ... clamps, clamps!
# Bender: Phew!
# Fry: Leela, we may not have much time left ... [Bender sneaks past them to an empty chair.] ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic.
# [Bender sits down, ties his arms up behind the chair and clears his throat.]
# Bender: Uh, help! Help!
- - Bender! You're OK!
  - Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
- - I've got an idea. Hold still. It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
  - Yeah that broke, alright!
# Bender: So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
- - Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
  - Oh, sweet legal tender!Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
- - It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
  - And maybe someday I won't listen.
