conversations:
- - Guidance system?
  - Online.
- - Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.
  - Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
- - Sabotage. This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.
  - Of course.
# Leela: And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.
# [She pulls a sheet off an L-unit. It is straight. Everyone gasps.]
# Fry: That doesn't look like an "L" at all. Unless you count lowercase.
# Bender: You know we don't!
- - Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
  - Hmm. It should look like this. But instead it looks like this.
- - Who would do a thing like that?
  - Who could do a thing like that? And by "that", I mean this.
# Leela: My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
# Farnsworth: That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
- - My God! Even the Professor's been bent. That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
  - I'll get you fixed up. That's fine.
- - Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?
  - I bent him.
# Amy: Aha!
# Hermes: Bender!
# Zoidberg: J'accuse!
# Bender: Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
- - Aha! Bender! J'accuse!
  - Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
- - Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
  - See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
- - Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
  - I'm sleepwalking.
- - You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!
  - This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
# [Flashback. Large robotic arms assemble a bending unit on a conveyor belt.]
# Bender: [voice-over] I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
- - Where are you from?
  - I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
- - Where were you born?
  - I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
# Bender: Mama. [He reaches out and cries. The robotic arm opens a bottle of Olde Fortran and screws a baby bottle-top onto it and feeds Bender. The conveyor belt moves and carries Bender to a machine marked "Bending School". Another robot arm comes out of it and installs bending software into his head. A third one hands him a diploma and puts a hat on his head then it throws the hat in the air.] Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
- - You remember your own birth?
  - Sure. It was only four years ago.
- - You're only four years old?
  - Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
# Bender: Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
- - Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday.
  - What?
- - And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage.
  - Ten-times normal wage? I'll give those jerks what for!
- - Welcomes aboard, scab.
  - Great to be here.
# Sal: Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with. [He points to a bending unit.] This here's our scab foreman.
# [The bending unit turns around.]
# Bender: Flexo?
# Flexo: Bender?
# Bender: Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
# Flexo: You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became! [He laughs.] Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!
- - And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine.
  - Hello.
# Sal: Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?
# [Robots move a pane of frosted glass from in front of Angle-ine, revealing her to be more heavily-built than Bender thought.]
# Bender: [more sexfully] Hello!
# Bender: Ow! [He strolls over to Angle-ine.] Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?
- - Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
  - That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?
- - What I always do. Jack squat.
  - Me too. Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
- - Well we are made of virtually identical components.
  - Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
# Bender: Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
# Bender: I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
- - Well my legs are made of rubber. And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac.
  - Oh, yeah? ... Prove it. ... Here, let me help you.
# Bender: Howdy, doodies. What's new?
- - I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--
  - Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
- - Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?
  - Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
- - Bam?
  - I met the most dynamite ladybot.
- - Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill.
  - Bless you, sir.
- - So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.
  - I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast. To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
# Fry: She sure does.
# [He points across the room. Bender turns and gasps. Flexo and Angle-ine sit at a table laughing.]
# Bender: Flexo!
# Elzar: [shouting] Careful, that's a week old!
# [Bender grunts and the stick breaks, then his arms fall off. He reattaches them and mutters to himself.]
# Bender: I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass. [He walks over to their table.] You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine.
- - Bender, it's-it's not what you think.
  - Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
- - Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.
  - Div-- Huh?
# Flexo: We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
# Bender: Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.
- - We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
  - Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.
# Steward: Excellent choice, sir.
# [Scene: Planet Express: Lounge. Bender paces backwards and forwards muttering to himself. Fry and Leela sit on the couch and Farnsworth leans against it. Leela reads a book.]
# Bender: [muttering] That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.
- - Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.
  - I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
# Leela: Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
# Fry: Yeah. Either that or be a man.
# Fry: That's thinkin' like a man.
# [Scene: Fry's and Bender's Lounge. At dusk, Bender paces around the apartment while Fry trims a plant into the shape of the Planet Express ship.]
# [Bender picks up the phone and dials.]
# Bender: [disguised voice] Hello? This is Flexo.
# [Scene: Outside The Hip Joint. A taxi flies towards the club and Bender gets out. It's Robot Nite and designated device drivers drink free. Bender opens his chest cabinet and sticks a goatee to his chin.]
# Bender: Now we'll see who loves whom.
# [He cackles and walks in.]
# [Cut to: The Hip Joint. Bender looks around and sees Angle-ine at the bar.]
# Bender: Hey, hot stuff.
- - Hey, Flexo. So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all.
  - Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo - The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house.
# Bartender-bot: Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
# [Bender takes a wad of cash out of his chest cabinet.]
# Bender: I hope they can make change for a fortune.
# [He tosses the cash over the bar. On the other side of the bar the Mafiabots watch him.]
# Bender: You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
- - Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
  - Bender? That walking wuss factory?
- - Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
  - But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?
- - You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
  - In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you. ... Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
- - You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!
  - I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
# Angle-ine: Alright!
# Bender: C'mon now, what's new! [His goatee flies off his face and lands on a fat Fembot's behind. Bender carefully removes it.] Ew!
# Angle-ine: Flexo? What-What's going on?
# [Bender laughs weakly and puts the goatee back on his face.]
# Bender: Um...
# [He grabs Angle-ine and tilts her back and she laughs.]
# Angle-ine: Flexo!
# [The robots dancing on the platforms start to fall apart and they rain on Bender and Angle-ine.]
# [Time Lapse. Bender and Angle-ine sit at a table as the janitor sweeps the robot parts off the empty floor.]
# Bender: So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!
# [They laugh.]
- - You always were a kick in the teeth, man.
  - Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
# Angle-ine: Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.
# Bender: [thinking] So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.
- - Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.
  - I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need. Tiparillo?
# Bender: Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.
- - Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.
  - How 'bout a lift? To your place.
# Angle-ine: What?
# Bender: Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by "me" I mean Flexo.
# Angle-ine: Hey, look, I had fun, but--
# Bender: But?
# 'Angle-ine: But--
# Bender: But?
- - Hey, look, I had fun, but--
  - But?
- - But... Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
  - That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.
- - Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
  - Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now - Kill Flexo. Ow!
# Flexo: Thanks, I appreciate that. [He laughs.] Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.
# Bender: You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
- - Please stop! I'm not worth it!
  - Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
# Flexo: Yeah, never better. [He coughs up oil.] Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.
- - You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
  - But, I love you.
- - I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.
  - But ... but... I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what.
- - What, what are you saying?
  - I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
- - You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
  - Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.
- - I'll always remember this, Bender.
  - Me too. Me too. Jerk. # [crying] Me too. Me too. [talking] Jerk.
- - So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.
  - Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
- - No, Bender! The other way.
  - I like him better this way.
