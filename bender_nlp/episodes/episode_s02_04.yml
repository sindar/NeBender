- - So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?
  - No, they fixed that 900 years ago.
- - Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--
  - I doubt it!
- - Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have - A soul!
  - Eh.
# O'Brien: And freckles! [Bender cries.] Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast.
# [The audience applauds.]
# [Scene: Catskill Mountains. The staff are geared up for skiing. They walk away from the lodge.]
# Bender: Ah, let's face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy... [He laughs.] That's funny!
- - This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened. Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
  - Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
# Fry: [hoarse] Trees down!
# Trees: [mechanical voice] Trees down.
# [They go back down and Fry gets buried under the snow with one. Bender speeds past on a snowboard. He is wearing a red and blue hat and has a cigar in his mouth.]
# Bender: Lookin' good, meatball!
- - Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
  - Lick my frozen, metal ass. Ahahahaha Uh-oh!
# Bender: Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
# Bender: [singing] : Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh.
- - Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas! Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
  - Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
# Bender: Hmm. [He opens the card. The message reads "Merry Xmas Son #1729". With it is a photo of a robotic arm.] Ah, a picture of my mommy.
- - My God! Poor Leela.
  - Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh. Look at me, look! Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
# Bender: Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
- - Where are you going, Bender?
  - To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
- - Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
  - I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
- - Whose blood?
  - Some guy's.
- - Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
  - Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
# Bender: Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. [He turns to another robot.] Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
# Tinny Tim: Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?
# Preacherbot: I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
# Tinny Tim: I understand.
# [He turns, coughs, and limps away.]
# Bender: My God! That poor kid!
- - Go away!
  - Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
- - Oh, alright. But just one glass! OK, that's enough. I said that's enough!
  - Get her purse!
# Bender: [singing] On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
# Robot #1: [singing] Four family photos.
# Tinny Tim: [singing] Three jars of pennies.
# Robot #2: [singing] Two former husbands.
# Bender: [singing] And a slipper on a shoe tree.
- - It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?
  - No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
- - Ho, ho, ho! You've been very naughty, Bender.
  - What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
- - Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
  - Use teamwork!
- - As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts.
  - Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you. Ow! God! The pain!
- - Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!
  - Xmas dinner, everyone.
- - Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
  - I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
# Tinny Tim: Thank you, sir.
# Bender: You got the toenail! [Nibbler eats the rest of the parrot and snatches Tinny Tim's piece off his plate.] Oh!
- - You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move.
  - You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
