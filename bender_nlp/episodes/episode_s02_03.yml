# Man: [on TV] Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity. [His glasses break.] It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books. [His eyes fall out and he screams.] It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille! [His hands fall off and he screams. Then his tongue falls out and finally his head comes off.] Hey, look at that weird mirror!
# [Fry shudders.]
# Bender: Cursed by his own hubris!
- - There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
  - Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
- - That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
  - Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
- - What party do you belong to, Bender?
  - I'm not allowed to vote.
- - Cause you're a robot?
  - No, convicted felon.
- - In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers.
  - What? Lord have mercy!
- - News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
  - Alright! I'm rich!
- - What are you talking about?
  - My body's 40% titanium! I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
- - Too bad you can't spend it.
  - Oh, can't I?
- - No.
  - Watch me, poor man.
- - Pleasure doing business with you.
  - Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves! 
# Bender: Hey, buddy. Little help? [The man kicks Bender into the air.] [shouting] Thank you!
# [Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Farnsworth, Leela and Fry are sat around the conference table. Fry is eating a bowl of Bachelor Chow. Bender's head flies through the window, bounces off the screen and lands in the middle of the table.]
# Bender: Hello, peasants.
# Leela: Bender? What happened to you?
- - Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
  - No, I sold my body.
- - This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
  - Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
- - Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
  - Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
# Bender: Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
# Bender: Shaken, not stirred. [The man shakes his head.] Aw, yeah!
# Bender: Put it all on black.
- - 21 red. I beg your pardon. 33 black.
  - Yes! The rich get richer!
# Bender: Strike! In your face, Leela! [He laughs. Leela rolls her ball and it hits Bender.] Ow!
# Bender: [shouting] Timber!
- - Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
  - Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
- - Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
  - I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things - poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! ... Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?
# Bender: Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?
# Bender: Ah, US presidents. [Leela sets his head down next to George Washington.] Sturdy shelves, good security. [Two bodyguard heads look at him.] This place has class.
# Bender: So then the hookerbot says, "That's not my expansion slot" and my friend says, "That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"
- - Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
  - You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
- - Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the "knock knock" jokes.
  - Pass.
- - So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
  - I hocked it.
- - Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
  - Same reason you hocked your teeth.
- - I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.
  - So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
- - No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
  - Oh, great. Now you tell me!
- - Bender, what is it?
  - Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
- - It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
  - I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
# Bender: You sold my body? To who?
# Bender: [crying] Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
- - Don't you have a self-destruct button?
  - Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
- - Bender, he's got your body!
  - That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
- - Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
  - Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
- - Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
  - Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!
- - Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
  - That was a good one!
- - Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!
  - It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
# Bender: Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
# Man: [from inside] We're in a room!
# Bender: Well then lose some weight.
- - We're in a room!
  - Well then lose some weight.
# Nixon: [sleep-talking] Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
# Bender: [whispering] Psst! There I am!
- - What the-- ... You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
  - I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
- - Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.
  - Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
# Bender: Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.
- - The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening ... and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
  - Get out of town!
- - I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
  - Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
