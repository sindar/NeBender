# - - What do you think of the seats Bender?
#   - Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
- - He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
  - Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
- - Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
  - Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
- - What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
  - Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
# - - Eleven?
# - - Eleven robot managers?
#   - Zero! And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
- - I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
  - Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
- - That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
  - Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
- - This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
  - Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
# # Fry: Really? Which one?
# # Bender: Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
# Leela: Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
# Fry: Man that one was a blast!
# Bender: It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
- - Man Robomadan was a blast!
  - It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
- - Man Robonzaa was a blast!
  - It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
- - Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
  - All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
- - So let me get this straight - This planet is completely uninhabited?
  - No. It's inhabited by robots!
- - OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
  - Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
# - - Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember - You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
#   - I'll try to keep that in mind!
- - And remember - You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
  - I'll try to keep that in mind!
# - - It's him. He's OK!
#   - Death to humans!
# Robot Mayor: Let the hunt begin!
# Bender: Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
- - Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?
  - Sure, why not?
- - Anything in the trap?
  - Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
- - Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
  - Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
- - We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
  - I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
- - Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
  - What for?
- - We're rescuing you.
  - I don't wanna be rescued.
- - Say what?
  - I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
- - But Bender, we're your friends.
  - Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
- - That's not true.
  - Well that's how it feels to me.
- - Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
  - Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
# - - Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!
#   - [uneasy] Heh heh heh! Oooh!
- - Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
  - Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
- - Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
  - Aww! I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
- - Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
  - Aww! I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
- - We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
  - Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
- - But that doesn't make it any less meaningful! # ?
  - In that case - let the dancing begin! Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
