conversations:
- - The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.
  - Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
# [A siren is heard from outside.]
# Bender: That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
# [The episodes are put inside a torpedo casing.]
# Takei: The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
# [As he speaks, a ship that looks like an Eagle from Space: 1999 fires the torpedo. It hits the planet like Spock's coffin in Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan. The video ends.]
# Nimoy: Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
# Bender: Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.

# Kif: Bender the robot, please take the stand.
# [Fry steps out of the wheelchair, perfectly healthy.]
# Fry: She's all yours, buddy!
# [Bender gets in.]
# Bender: I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
- - Bender the robot, please take the stand. She's all yours, buddy!
  - I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
# Leela: You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
# Fry: But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
# Leela: But it's set 800 years in the past!
# Bender: Yeah, why is this so important to you?
- - You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you! But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future. But it's set 800 years in the past!
  - Yeah, why is this so important to you?
# Fry: 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.
# Leela: Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
- - Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
  - I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
- - Warning - You are now in forbidden space.
  - Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? Ooh, I'm so scared!
- - You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!
  - Yowza!
# [A deep, booming voice interrupts them.]
# Melllvar: It is I!
# [Everyone gasps and looks up. Above them is a hovering, green cloud.]
# Bender: Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
- - It is I!
  - Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
- - I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
  - I do.
- - Now, we have a full schedule of events--
  - Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
# Melllvar: Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. "Melllvar" has three "L's".
# Takei: I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell "Melllvar".
# [Time Lapse. The cast and Melllvar stand in front of a backdrop having their photo taken by Bender.]
# Bender: Say "nerd"!
- - Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. Melllvar has three Ls.
  - Say nerd!
- - This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
  - I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
# Fry: Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.
- - Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
  - Like putting too much air in a balloon!
# [Scene: Ships Jeffries Tube. Bender welds something in the Planet Express ships equivalent to Scotty's tube.]
# Bender: [shouting] OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
# [Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The ship crashes and the engine falls off. The crew crawl out from underneath.]
# Bender: Yup!
# Melllvar: Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
# Koenig: Keep them and let us go?
# Melllvar: No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
- - To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
  - Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
# [By the "Guardian of Forever" prop, Leela drops a pile of sticks next to Fry.]
# Leela: There. We can make these into spears.
# Fry: And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
# Bender: And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! [He pulls out a Tommy gun from behind a rock and expends the entire round. Fry and Leela glare at him and he chuckles.] That was fun!
- - There. We can make these into spears. And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
  - And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! That was fun!
- - Hello, boys!
  - Whoa!
# [Leela hits him in the face. He hits back and she dodges his punch and kicks him in the chest. He flies back and hits the ground. She jumps on top him and repeatedly smacks him in the face. Fry fights DeForest Kelley while Bender takes on Nimoy, Koenig and Takei.]
# Bender: Come on, Walter!
# [Melllvar groans and disappears.]
# Fry: All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
# Melllvar's Mother: He's not a child, he's 34!
# [She disappears.]
# Bender: Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
# [He grabs him by his shirt and holds up his fist. Fry grabs his arm.]
# Fry: Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.
# Takei: Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like "destruct
# sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"
# [Bender's head explodes, leaving some wires, coils and his mouth poking out of his body.]
# Bender: Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
- - Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--
  - Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
