conversations:
# [DiMaggio beatboxes while Billy West scats the theme song.]
# Bender: Aw, New New York City! Woooo! Woooo! Don' worry about it! Do the robot, baby!
- - Shh! What was that sound?
  - It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. Aww, they're so cute when they're scared.
- - Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little "just friends" spooning.
  - Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!
# Ranger Park: [holding up a bag] I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot.
# Farnsworth: Shut up!
# [Bender stands up and points out the window.]
# Bender: Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!
- - I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot.
  - Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!
- - Where?
  - Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though.
# Fry: Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?
- - Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke.
  - Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!
- - Where?
  - Up your face! Everybody do the Bender!
- - You doin' alright out there, buddy?
  - Better than these gnats! That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
# [Time Lapse. Everyone sleeps. Bender shivers and rotates his head around like an owl. Something "coos".]
# Bender: Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent. [He hides behind a rock.] [deep voice] Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!
# [Cut to: Fry's Tent. Fry wakes up.]
# Bender: [from outside] Come out and groom my mangy fur!
- - Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?
  - Bender!
# Zoidberg: Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. [He shakes him.] [shouting] Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
# Fry: What?
# [He pokes his face and looks at his reflection in Bender's door. He screams.]
# Bender: Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!
- - Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
  - Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!
# Farnsworth: Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
# [Enter Bender panting and gasping.]
# Bender: [gasping] Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
# Fry: Uh, I'm looking for human horn.
# Salesman: [whispering] Shh! You're not cops, right?
# Leela: Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
- - Shh! You're not cops, right? Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
  - Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
- - So let me get this straight - If I buy eight Caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp.
  - Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
# Bender: Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?
- - But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle.
  - No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!
# Fry: Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
# Bender: [shouting] I'll say!
# [He hoots.]
# Fry: But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
# Bender: [shouting] That's what she said!
- - Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
  - I'll say!
- - But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
  - That's what she said!
# [The guard starts the cutter again.]
# Fry: Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
# Leela: Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.
# Nd-Nd: Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it.
# Lrrr: Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.
- - Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
  - I don't get it!
# [Scene: Duraflame National Forest. Lrrr and Nd-Nd are seated at a table under the night sky. The trees have lights strung around them. Bender carries a box of Monsieur Carton.]
# Bender: Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
- - Mmm! This jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
  - It's used to it!
# [He hoots. Fry is wheeled to the table.]
# Fry: So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?
# Nd-Nd: Poorly.
# Lrrr: My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
- - So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing? Poorly. My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
  - Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin? Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?
# Leela: Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written.
# (singing badly) And I will always love you,
# [The Omicronians cover their ears.]
# Will always love you.
# Nd-Nd: The humans are attacking!
# Lrrr: Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
- - Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
  - Quick, Fry! Run for it!
- - Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
  - Just like at the movie theatre!
# Ranger Park: Holy macaroni! [He takes some photos.] I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment.
# [He pulls out a gun and points it at Bigfoot. Everyone mutters.]
# Nd-Nd: What?
- - Holy macaroni! I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment.
  - What are you doing with that?
- - This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--
  - In this case small!
- - Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
  - As usual! Run away!
