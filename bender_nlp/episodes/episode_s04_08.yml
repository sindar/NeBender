  - Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!
- - Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
  - Focus!
# [Scene: Halley's Comet Surface. The ship lands and the cargo lift comes down. Bender moves a piece of machinery off the ship and onto the comet. Fry and Leela walk onto the roof wearing their red space suits.]
# Bender: [shouting] Deploying ice drill.
# Fry: Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you! [He chuckles.] Yakov Smirnov said it.
# Leela: No, he didn't.
# [Bender pushes the giant cup onto the ice dispenser.]
# Bender: [shouting] Activating ice drill.
- - Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you! Yakov Smirnov said it. No, he didn't.
  - Activating ice drill.
# [The drill drills through the surface but only a bit of grit comes through the dispenser.]
# Fry: Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
# [Leela gasps.]
# Leela: Completely out of ice?
# Bender: This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
- - Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6! Completely out of ice?
  - This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
- - Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland.
  - That poor turtle!
- - Bender? Are you crying?
  - Uh, no! Never!
# [Scene: Outside Planet Express. The crew sit on some steps.]
# Bender: Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?
- - Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
  - Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
- - What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
  - For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know.
- - You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?
  - No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
- - What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
  - Those times I was slightly on my side.
- - Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender.
  - Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me. Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you.
- - Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected. We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be.
  - I got a good feeling about this!
- - We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!
  - No!
# [She opens it and tempts him with it. He reaches out to grab it and the others grab his arm.]
# Fry: Aha!
# Leela: Gotcha!
# Bender: Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! [They struggle with the bottle. Bender pulls it away and runs off with it.] Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? [He cackles and his head comes out. He drinks the beer and flag appears on his antenna.] I've got mail!
- - Aha! Gotcha!
  - Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? I've got mail!
# [Bender opens it and Nixon's head spins around in it.]
# Nixon: [on card] Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend.
# Zoidberg: Strange: Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? [He snaps his claws.] It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! [No one reacts.] I don't hear any gasping.
# Leela: We all figured that out.
# [Zoidberg groans.]
# Bender: Well, I'm off.
- - Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
  - No. I'm going to the party.
- - I won't let you!
  - Buddy, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for - This mindless turtle. #buddy = Fry
- - Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
  - Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead. It's booby trapped!
# Robot #1: Oh, yeah!
# Robot #2: Come on, baby!
# [Bender looks at his turtle as robots conga past him.]
# Bender: Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink. [He pumps a keg but it is dry.] Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!
# Keg Robot: Don't stop!
# Bender: Ew!
- - Do you want to dance?
  - Nah, I'm not really in the--
# [Scene: Galapagos Islands. Bender talks to Shelly.]
# Bender: I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. [whispering] Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--
# [The Refreshment-bot screams. Bender kicks over Boxy and uses him as a soapbox.]
# Bender: Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender! [The robots stop panicking and turn around. Roberto stabs the robot who couldn't make his payments in Bender Gets Made.] Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot. [The Hedonismbot eats grapes.] But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!
- - I apologise for nothing!
  - We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
# - - I apologize for nothing!
#   - We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
- - To hell with the turtles!
  - No one insults the turtles!
- - Oh, mercy!
  - Come on!
- - I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--
  - You're one to talk!
# [Bender is still on his back, unable to vent. He kicks his legs.]
# Bender: Help! Help!
# [Bender and the turtle are still on their backs.]
# Bender: I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless. [The turtle starts to rock from side to side.] Huh? What the hell are you doing? [It rocks onto it's feet and walks away.] Hey, you trying to make me look bad? [He rocks on his back, working his body with his arms and manages to get up.] Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny.
# [The robots cheer.]
# Bender: Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?
# Farnsworth: Why, yes! One week longer to be exact.
- - In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
  - Alright, baby!
