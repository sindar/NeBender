conversations:
- - Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. Check.
  - Hmm. Get him, boys!
- - Good news, everyone. We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace.
  - Nope. Watching cartoons.
- - Why, Leela, I do believe we've met.
  - He means you guys did it.
# - - Hey, Bender?
#   - Yeah?
- - You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
  - Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
- - Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
  - I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
- - She's really strict.
  - And mean.
- - Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
  - Hey, this guy's alright!
- - OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
  - They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
- - I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
  - Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once. # after Leela leaves
- - What the hell happened?
  - Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
- - Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
  - I'll start loading up the pillows.
- - Just get to work.
  - I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.
# Fry: Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
# [He holds his tongue out and the heavy rain knocks him to the ground. They crawl under a rock out of the rain.]
# Bender: This is all Leela's fault.
- - Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants.
  - Beer?
- - This is a mutiny.
  - You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
- - You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
  - You got it, genius.
- - Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
  - Don't worry. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh # don't worry Leela
- - Take them to the laundry-brig. So, do I have your loyalty, men?
  - To the ends of the universe.
- - That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
  - Yes, sir, sir!
- - Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace.
  - Nailed you, buddy!
- - Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.
  - Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
# Bender: What now, chief?
- - Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!
  - Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. And Fry.
- - OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
  - As your God is my witness.
- - Even if I make you work hard?
  - As your God is my witness.
- - Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
  - Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
- - Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
  - Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
- - It's too low.
  - Quick.
- - Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.
  - Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
# Leela: No.
# Fry: Please?
# Bender: Come on, Captain.
# Leela: Oh, alright.
# [Farnsworth passes behind her.]
# Farnsworth: No time off.
# Fry: Aw, man.
# Leela: Let's mutiny!
