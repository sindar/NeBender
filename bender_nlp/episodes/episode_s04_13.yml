conversations:
# [Scene: Madison Cube Garden. Bender and Zoidberg watch some competitors warm up on the field. All is quiet between the two.]
# Bender: Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting. [The robots flex their robot muscles.] Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals. [A crane drops three unbendable girders into the hands of a robot. The robot bends them with little effort. Bender gasps as he watches. The robot holds up the bent girders.] Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.
# Farnsworth: [shouting] Go, bodysuit, go!
# Zoidberg: [shouting] Go!
# Bender: [shouting] C'mon!
- - Go, bodysuit, go!
  - C'mon!
- - Aw, there, there, Hermes. You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
  - Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
- - Up next, the Fembot bending competition.
  - Fembots? Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
# [Time Lapse. Bender, wearing a dress and headscarf, impatiently waits for officials to look for his entry form.]
# Bender: What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
- - Yes but Robonia sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.
  - Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
- - A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all! Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!
  - I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
- - You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
  - Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career. Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!
- - Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
  - I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
- - If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--
  - Pft.
# [Scene: Outside Robot Medical Tent. Three robots line up outside for treatment. One has been impaled on a fencing sword, another has been impaled with five javelins and another has been impaled on a tennis racket. Bender holds up the side of the tent and ushers Farnsworth, Fry and Leela inside.]
# Bender: [whispering] C'mon!
#===============Coilette==================
# Maybe add Coilette dialogues here, idk
#===============Coilette==================
# [Bender's antenna springs up.]
# Bender: Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!
# Fry: Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
- - I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
  - Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?
- - C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy.
  - Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
# [Fry leaves and he starts out after him. He stops and looks at the TV.]
# Calculon: [on TV] Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove.
# [Bender's eyes well up with tears.]
# Bender: Goodnight, Calculon.
- - Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove.
  - Goodnight, Calculon.
- - What did you say?
  - I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
