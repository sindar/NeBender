- - Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
  - Ooh! Ooh! I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered - What if I was 500-feet tall?
- - Let's watch, shall we?
  - My work here is done!
- - I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Who are you?
  - I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
- - You too? Will you be my friend?
  - Put it there, pal! I meant your wallet.
# Bender: Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. [The troops shoot him with electricity guns.] Hey! [They shoot again and Bender just laughs.] [laughing] Aw, quit it! Come on!
- - So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city? Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you? Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. "Boo" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!
  - Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!
- - Tell it to claw.
  - Bite my colossal metal ass!
# Zoidberg: Stop!
# Bender: [shouting] Who wants lobster bisque?
- - Hey, Bender?
  - Huh?
- - Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
  - Who put this in here?
- - Nooo! Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
  - I'll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream - A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I. Not I.
- - Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
  - Go, man! Go!
# Bender: Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
# Leela: No! Everything's just--
# Bender: Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. [He starts clearing the garbage disposal.] And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
- - I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
  - Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
- - You're blackmailing me?
  - Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion". The "X" makes it sound cool. Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
# Bender: Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
- - Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
  - Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
