conversations:
# [Scene: Planet Express: Hangar. Bender is kitted out in golf gear. To his left is a screen displaying a virtual golf course. He is on the 17th hole (a par 4). He takes his club from Fry and puts the ball on the tee.]
# Bender: A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings! [He hits the ball and it interacts with the screen, landing in the lake.] Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man! [He plugs a cable into his head and appears on the screen.] [muttering] Boy, I tell you, buddy!
- - Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
# Fry: Hooray!
  - Not good enough!
# [They high-five. Leela descends from above in a harness.]
# Leela: Why? Says who?
- - Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
# Fry: Woo-hoo!
  - We live to suck another day!
# [He bursts into tears.]
# Farnsworth: These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
# Fry: Larger than an American sedan? [He gasps.] How big is the honeycomb?
# Hermes: Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
# Bender: It's not small?
- - Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - It's not small?
- - So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
  - Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance.  #[He dances.] [in bee] You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it.
# - - Bender, quick! Waggle something!
#   - Uh ... [in bee] Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
# [Fry and Bender wince.]
# [Time Lapse. The crew crawl into part of the honeycomb and honey drips around them.]
# Bender: Ew!
# [She dips a jar into the jelly.]
# Bender: [in bee] Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks. [The bees glare at Bender.] I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
# [Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. Her stinger comes through with Bender on the end.]
# Bender: I'm back, baby!
# Leela: You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry. [There is no response.] [alarmed] Fry?! [Fry is hunched over on the floor, clutching where the sting hit him. Leela gasps.] He's... he's dead!
# [She and Bender kneel beside him.]
# Bender: [crying] Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
# [Behind her, the radiator from the Miss Universe pageant, Petunia, the girl from the Hip Joint, Morgan Proctor and Michelle aren't so sure.]
# Bender: All those times I said "Kill all humans," I'd always whisper "except one". Fry was that one. [sobbing] And I never told him so!
# [Enter Bender counting some cash and whistling.]
# Bender: Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
- - Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
  - No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, Jose! Here it is.
- - You took this from Fry's locker?
  - Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
# Bender: Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
# [Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender is on fire. Hermes, Amy, Zoidberg and Farnsworth blast him with fire extinguishers.]
# Bender: That's better!
# [He lights a cigar. Enter Leela with Fry's jacket in a cover.]
# Leela: Fry's alive! I have proof!
# Amy: No way!
# Farnsworth: You lie!
# Bender: You do not!
- - Fry's alive! I have proof!
  - You do not!
- - Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
  - A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
# Leela: I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
# Farnsworth: You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!
# Zoidberg: One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
# Hermes: [Farnsworth's voice] Never!
# Bender: [Amy's voice] Never!
- - Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--
  - And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
- - Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being.
  - This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again. Let's go get hammered!
# Leela: I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me.
# Hermes: Oh, take it easy, Leela.
# Amy: In every life we have some trouble.
# Bender: But when you worry, you make it double.
- - In every life we have some trouble.
  - But when you worry, you make it double.
# Amy and Bender: [singing] Don't worry! Bee happy!
# Farnsworth: [singing] The landlord says your rent is late.
# Hermes: [singing] He might have to litigate.
# Bender: [singing] But don't worry!
# [The bee stings him and he explodes.]
# Amy: OK! I'm happy!
# [The bee stings her and she explodes. Streamers and glitter fall around the table and Bender dances on it.]
# Bender: Take us home, Bender! [singing] Don't worry!
# Bee: [singing] Bee--
# [It stings him.]
# Bender: [singing] Happy!
- - Uh, were you just singing?
  - No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
# Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy and Bender: [chanting] You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!
# Leela: Stop it! Stop it!
# [She tears their faces down like paper. Bender appears on the floor.]
# Bender: You killed Fry!
# Hermes: Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
# [They all cheer.]
# Bender: You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
- - Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
  - You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
